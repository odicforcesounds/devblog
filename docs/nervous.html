      <p>I normally have a lot of patience, but this last month's I am getting upset very easy. I don't know what the heck is happening to me, but my tolerance to what I think is wrong, make me mad. So, maybe the wrong is on me, and even if I can explain in a rational way, why I get upset, I should try to understand that I cannot expect that others see the world, the same I do. Inside groups chats or individual chats, when I make a question, I expect an answer, even if the answer to my question is "no". But it looks like, being silent or not giving an answer is as well, a way to say "no", without saying "no". This doesn't make any sense, but I need to accept the condition. Is like when I ask: "do you agree with me?", and if you don't agree, I expect you tell me that you don't agree and explain why you don't agree. But the world doesn't work like that, or at least most of the people don't. If I ask "Can you help me on this?", and you don't answer if you can or not. So, I need to understand and accept that you cannot help. This doesn't make any sense to me, but I cannot change your ways just because I believe that attitude is incorrect.</p>
