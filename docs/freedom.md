## FreeBSD vs Gentoo

Have you ever installed Gentoo Linux? If you ever did, then you know how much pain you pass through just to have your Linux box ready to serve your needs. 

[Gentoo](./blog/distros/gentoo.md) is a learning process and the worst of it, is when you need to update, which need to be something like once per week. If you take longer, you will find some USE="Flags" problems in the process, while many other problems can happen before you even boot it from the first time. I encourage you to try, mainly if you are a big FAN of memory usage performance and CPU performance too. Compilation time is your best friend, and hopefully you know to leave the computer away for some time, when compiling software. For exemple, to compile GCC that may take several hours. Anyway, when you boot your Gentoo for the first time, in case you already compile the kernel from the source, which you specify which hardware you have and which software compability you wish to have, the software you add, will be at its best, for your machine. 

With FreeBSD, installation is super easy and no problems will come for installing it in your machine (mostly). After than super-fast installation, you can think you are using Gentoo. FreeBSD *ports* have everything you need to start. Use the *which* command to find the programs you wish to install and go into that directory and install them all, using the *make* command. But wait, before installing anything you should compile the kernel. The kernel you are using is generic and what you need is only the code that make your hardware work. All other hardware devices that you don't have or use, can be removed, which will results in a faster kernel. In the end, reboot and start software compilation. You can start with *GCC* if you wish, to remember how much time it takes in Gentoo, while **FreeBSD** will ask you so many questions in the process of installing one single software, that you can quit from installing it from the source. Even if you can use *pkg* package to install the binary versions, you can escape that annoying problem with `make BATCH=yes install clean`, but keep in mind that some packages have X11 features included, so you may wish to investigate the `Makefile` of each package you wish to install, to be sure that you will not install, what you don't need. For example `Vim` will install the X. In my perspective this is completly insane, but what can I do against it? **Offend FreeBSD developers** :)
