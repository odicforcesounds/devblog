      <p>It is really funny to think, that humanity did develop simbology to describe some civic functionality related to some animals. Police force normally use Tigers, Lions and other kind of "Cats", that in the Savana are the ones that attack innocents to feed their animality. By that principle, is normal to accept that all unfair choices made by the police forces around the globe "normal", since the symbol that represent them are in reality unfair to innocent and peaceful animals. But you should think better about this, since Birds and <a href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/OscarFM/index.html">Monkeys</a> ( that are not the Kings of the Jungle ), are in fact the BEST police that the majority need to have, to notice them about the danger, without the will to punish the innocent for being free of movement. </p>
      <p>But it is up to you what kind of approach you would like to have for you, since Justice can only happen with conscience, while Justice is a instrument of Education, that don't inform others to guide them for better choices. Therefor, Justice become a Criminal instrument that feel it self better than what Educations aims to share, blocking education it self for being part of the solution. But for me is ok, if you like to be punished for doing something wrong and be arrested in the middle of many other criminals that maybe did something worst than you, which can lead you to be victim of their madness, by raping you or killing you for no reason, I cannot block your decision. I am the Monkey and the only thing the Monkeys can do, is to give instructions about reality, pointing to some direction with a possible solution for many.</p>
      <p>But sometimes I think I understand how some cultures feed the need to be violent against others without the ability to the a guide without being violent, since I only need to open the newspaper to see the majority feeling that, that approach is the only way. As I like to say, if you agree with those approach's, then you can be educated to not use them, using them against you. ;) </p>
