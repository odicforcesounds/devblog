      <p>It is really funny to think, that humanity did develop simbology to describe some civic functionality related to some animals. Police force normally use Tigers, Lions and other kind of "Cats", that in the Savana are the ones that attack innocents to feed their animality. By that principle, is normal to accept that all unfair choices made by the police forces around the globe "normal", since the symbol that represent them are in reality unfair to innocent and peaceful animals. But you should think better about this, since Birds and <a href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/OscarFM/index.html">Monkeys</a> ( that are not the Kings of the Jungle ), are in fact the BEST police that the majority need to have, to notice them about the danger, without the will to punish the innocent for being free of movement. </p>
