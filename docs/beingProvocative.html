      The percentage of visitors to this site is getting lower, comparing to the last years, but they continue, even if I didn't invest a single coin to promote it. So thank you so much for sharing my sites with your friends, and thank you to your friends for doing the same. Anyway, the sites continue to get this "stupid" attacks, that will fail, from people that don't know how to hack websites, while that, is on each day, more difficult, even more when sites are only made with HTML and CSS, and stored somewhere in a platform that can deal with much more complexities, than simple HTML and CSS requests, even if all of them are only HTTP requests at the end. :) I think this hackers could try to masturbate them selfs, and don't waste their time trying to attack me, since they will fail. Monkey is Monkey. Wanna bet you will fail? If you masturbate yourself, at least you will not fail the point, and at least you can have some fun, enjoying the process and in the end, feel some pleasure! I am so tier of this "hackers", that I feel that I need to be provocative with them, while there are hackers that know how to do things, without using applications made to do those things, based on patterns that...I don't use! I am a Monkey remember? I am different from everything you can imagine!
