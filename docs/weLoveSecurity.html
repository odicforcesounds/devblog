      <p>I really like to read the publications of this blog, but sometimes I think that, these security folks, use what is not supposed to exist. From Crypt.in to Bitwarden, 1password and others, they are ONLINE. Who the Heck going to use a Online Service to store their personal and sensitive information? I don't get it.</p>
      <p>The article "Can password managers get hacked?" talks about some crazy ads that redirect users to some fake domain very similar to the original sites ( phishing ) to steal data from users, but the problem I see, is that, no one should store their sensitive data online. Mainly the Password Managers. I use KeepassXC and I HATE the option to enable to share anything Online, while in Gentoo, we can unable this stupid option, that doesn't make any sense to exist. I don't know what is the intentions of any of the above sites application and I cannot guaratee that they are total secure. So, to someone that have some privacy / security problems, using a Online Password Manager is like shuting the foot.</p>
      <p>I try to save and backup everything I need to a hard drive, that is 99% of the time, offline. I deny to save passwords in the Browser and in any other way that can be exposed online. The best I used to use, was encrypted files using GPG and expose them in Google Driver for example, but since I don't know if Google is trustful, I remove them from there. Last year, for the first time in Life I buy this "cute and stupid mobil phones" called Android and is always offline. Why the Heck someone wish to put their phone always online? Is that necesary? No is Not!!! Sometimes I think this blog is based on Window$ users, since is always talking about the ESET anti-virus that is another Window$ crap. I love Windows, Offline. Is the best OS for gamming, Offline. The best OS (offline). Always offline is secure and fast. No AV is needed and no obvious danger can happen on this machine. There is no private things or documents in this computer, so if you have physical access to it, to hack my Horrible Payed OS, the only thing you are enable to do, is to play some game. I don't even use by default a administrative user. So, the attacker, will lose his time for nothing. Anyway, is good that this blogs full of awareness about security, but sometimes I think they are not very "security focused", since I would never recommend someone to use a Online Password Manager. That is Insane!!</p>
