      <p>Imagine a world like <a href="./unfairLearning.html">this</a> one. A world were children do mistakes and the feedback for their learning is to insult them, to hit them, to humiliate them, just by saying they are stupid, crazy or gay, just because they did some mistake. If it doesn't look like "hell", something similar is. The Dragon (China and Japan) normally don't use that technique to teach, but put children in a condition that without being violent to them, they will feel some pain. In cities, children can be victims of violence, for doing something wrong, mistakes or being late. In the country side is the same, so the difference is not from where each one did born, but how their parents define the limits. Education can be fun, full of games and intertainments, while learning about any subject, since is the technique that create a connection between the individual and the subject, without craeting rejections. </p>
