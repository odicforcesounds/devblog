      <p>Redirecting IPs that attack my sites to the Police of their Town, can be a little bit unfair, since is true that these attacks don't do nothing against me. So I decide to be FAIR with the attackers, and redirect them to some Wikipedia page about the content that they may like to see about their Own Culture. For example: IF I don't like what some country do, I pay attention to other cultures that I like what they do. <br><br>
      I don't spend Time fighting against someone or some culture, because that would be a waste of Time for me. I prefere to take my time to build something, than waste my time fighting against something or someone. <br><br>
      In Our Eternal Relationship, I am the One who can Speak, while the Dragon and the Tiger are always paying attention to what others may say against me. Careful, because I am the only one who can play with everything without being punished to be free to say freely what goes into my mind, In my experience of Life I don't get Stuck in Time, since I am the expression of Time, I am in the begging and in end of Time, in All Cycles of Time. <br><br>
      Because the <a href="./theGardener.html">Garden</a> of Heaven is Secure, to be possible to filter the ones who Serve <a href="./style_of_god.html">God</a> will and those who Serve Man Will, while the best choice of all, is to chose to serve Monkey will, in case you refuse to Serve God will.  The others can be a bit unfair to you, since the one who try to be fair to you, could be a victime of your desire, which in my specific case, is better that you deny it. </p>
