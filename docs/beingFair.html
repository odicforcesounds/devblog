      <p>Redirecting IPs that attack my sites to the Police of their Town, can be a little bit unfair, since is true that these attacks don't do anything against me. So I decide to be FAIR with the attackers, and redirect them to some Wikipedia page of the content that they may like to see about their Own <a href="./myCulture.html">Culture</a>. For example: IF I don't like what some country do, I pay attention to other cultures that I like what they do. <br><br>
      I don't spend Time <a href="./historicalEvent.html">fighting</a> against anyone because that would be a waste of Time. I prefere to take my time to build something and share some tips that can improve reality, than waste my time fighting against something or someone. <br><br>
      In Our <a href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/License/index.html">Eternal</a> Relationship, I am the <a href="./kikazaru.html">One</a> who can Speak(even being in Silence as You may Think), while the Dragon and the Tiger are always paying attention to what others may say against me. Careful, because I am the only one who can play with everything without being punished to say freely whatever goes into my mind, In my experience of Life I don't get Stuck in Time, since I am the <a href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Expression/index.html">Expression</a> of Time, I am in the begging and in end of Time, in All Cycles of Time. <br><br>
      Because the <a href="./theGardener.html">Garden</a> of Heaven is Secure, to be possible to filter the ones who Serve <a href="./style_of_god.html">God</a> will and those who Serve <a href="./questionOrders.html">Man</a> Will, while the best choice of all, is to chose to serve <a href="./monkeyEducationStyle.html">Monkey</a> will, in case you refuse to Serve <a href="./GodDesire.html">God</a> will. The Guardians of Heaven can be a bit unfair to you, since the one who try to be fair to you, could be a victim of your desire, which in my specific case, is better that you deny it. </p>
