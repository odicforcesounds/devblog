      <p>The problem in our history, mainly for the Military activity, is that some of them, enjoy the killing activity and therefor, they may wish to continue the activity, even when someone told them to stop. But you known, sometimes I feel I understand that <a href="./excitedMoments.html">choice</a>. They are excited to have full permissions to kill and if that create on them some joy, we can say "Oh, so that was the reason.."</p>
      <p>But, normal people who able to think, may think: Are this persons killing inocent people for no reasons? And the answer may surprise you. (Yes, just for fun)</p>
      <p class="center">Simple Solutions for Complex Problems.</p>
      <p>So, since I want to believe that the military have some moral principles, to escape from that <b>joy</b> event that is older than we think, we can substitute the Soldiers with Murders. Then we will see them doing the same that Soldiers do, but we will not be surprised. "Oh, that is normal, since they are murders.. what do you expect from them anyway?"</p>
      <p>If they implement this approach, I will not say that "military" do some crimes ( in a compulsive historical way ), because I know that these persons are not military, but murders. In the perspective of a country that use violent approach's to solve simple problems, this solution is like a "Light in the Dark" for them. I just feel sad, that they will not pay me for giving them, the best solution they may have for Free.</p>
