      <p>Christianity was in Time, just another religion like all others, that grow for the Peace of others without any connection with the military. </p>
      <p>After the 4 century of Christianity Peaceful Life, Constantine (a Nordic Pagan) tell the Church that he had a Vision where the Cross was the Symbol of Victory. Constantine lead the war and the Cross, used in that war that Constantine win, was used to declare to the world that the Cross is the Symbol that represent the Eternal "Touch" of God Will. </p>
      <p>This start take Christianity to conquer many  countries and cultures around the world, by raping their cultures and beliefs, raping woman, children, man, torturing, killing and all the creepy things that we can see in movies. (but not so brutal, as it was in Reality)</p>
      <p>They always try to find their place where they could leave in Peace? They create that possibility (in a <a href="./questionOrders.html">Criminal</a> style. Then, since criminality like all non-criminal need to become better, somewhere in Time they become better. (at least the 2 Version of the Bible aims to be Better than the First (Torah) because there was a desire to become better. It is in this moments that the Jews, are the Inspiration of Christians, while Christians didn't recognize it, since is the same book with some modifications, for many centuries they start to fight by the will to <a href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/tracks/06_Dominated_by_Time_Ruled_by_Desire/index.html">Dominate</a> what "God" gave them, to understand the Creation of their living conscience (without the Will to Rule)
  </p>. 
    <p class="center">Jesus Christ was: <code>A simple Man with values that aim to archive any possibility without using any kind of Violence.</code></p>
    <p>The desire that is forbidden (is what the majority do because is Forbidden (I can see the Monkey who doesn't See)) ... Question: It is forbidden to Write? (gladly I can) -- COOL!</p>
    <p>The simplicity of Jesus even to put away the business man from the Church building, didn't use techniques like Torture, Spanking, Raping and all toher Values that are in Jesus speech are GUIDES of Choices.. Does believers Learn the Guides or they fall in Love with the other Side? </p>
    <p>The other side is the military side, where by murdering people, you can continue to rule the world (of God creation that didn't Give You those instructions). Should I say "God Bless You" ? I don't because I believe that God already Bless everyone, to be here experiencing Life, while doing what each should do focusing in helping others not judge and punish others, even if Judgement is a Value that All Living Being With <a href="./usingTheBrain.html">Brain</a> have in Memory, which is the Function that able Cats, Dogs, Pigs, and other living being including Humans, to understand the difference between what is Good and Friendly and What is Not.</p>
    <p>Anyway, is good that Christinaity after so many Centuries of being Erroneous, and celebrating life of the "loved one" in a <a href="./strangeCelebrations.html">strange</a> style to celebrate <a href="./DragonFire.html">Life</a> of others "Good" human Lifes, like the Eternal <a href="./leadersOfHistory.html">Leaders</a> of Our History, to be able to become better, because that is the Only and Unique Purpose in Life of God <a href="./GodDesire.html">Eternal Will</a></p>
