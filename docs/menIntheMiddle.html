      <p>The Sky is blue and in this site is only me and you</p>
      <p>Suricata have this long(2354 lines) config file, to deal with traffic, while Suricata <a href="https://docs.suricata.io/_/downloads/en/suricata-6.0.16/pdf/">documentation</a> lead us to understand deeper, how to analize traffic and how to create rules for it, in a technical perspective. People say that both, <b>Suricata</b> and <b>Snort</b> consume a lot of hardware resources, but I see them as tools that are needed to secure sites. Snort <a href="https://snort-org-site.s3.amazonaws.com/production/document_files/files/000/000/249/original/snort_manual.pdf">documentation</a> is more or less the same, while reading about both, we learn even more about the traffic, while learning about, how to deal with it. </p>
      <p>Both <b>sniffers</b> as a cocaine addicted, use <a href="./permissionProblems.html">animals</a> as logos, but that is the creative part of each. I like that approach, since I do the same with my sites.</p>
      <p>I don't know who is the men between me and this site, but there are many, I am sure.</p>
      <p>Sniff.. Sniff.. They Sniff and are not Sick.</p>
