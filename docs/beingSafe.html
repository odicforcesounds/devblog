    <p>Last <a href="./freedom.html">post</a> I mention the beauty of
    Jails.</p>
    Is like being at home. At home, you are in “Jail”,
    while that condition give you some safeness from the outside world.</p>
    <p>Jails in FreeBSD are awesome, and they feel like being at home.</p>
    <p>Your FreeBSD installation don’t need all the packages you wish to
    install, since what you want, is to put them all arrested in a dedicated
    Jail.</p>
    <p>Sadly in reality, jails are not so safe, but at least in this “world
    of emulations”, being safe is possible.</p>
    <p>I think there is a problem with this blog layout and colors.</p>
    <p>I will change everything, because the walls of my sell are not so
    white, and even if they were, I would Love to paint on them.</p>
    <p>Life is durty and hugly, while being beautiful on that condition.
    <br>
    Thank you “God”, for being contradictory, since contradictions are part of
    what is the real Truth between everything.</p>
    <p>The truth is on the limits… in that small line, where you are
    nowhere, while in each side of you, you are somewhere.</p>
