<h1 class="title1">Being in Jail for Security</h1>
<h2 class="title2">The [Being Super Dumb] aka
<strong>BSD</strong></h2>
<p>Last <a href="./freedom.md">post</a> I mention the beauty of
Jails.</p>
<p>Jails are a way (older then most applications we know) that are
isolated process. Is like being at home. At home, you are in “Jail”,
while that condition give you some safeness from the outside world.</p>
<p>Jails in FreeBSD are awesome, and they feel like being at home.</p>
<p>Your FreeBSD installation don’t need all the packages you wish to
install, since what you want, is to put them all arrested in a dedicated
Jail.</p>
<p>Sadly in reality, jails are not so safe, but at least in this “world
of emulations”, being safe is possible.</p>
<p>I think there is a problem with this blog layout and colors.</p>
<p>I will change everything, because the walls of my sell are not so
white, and even if they were, I would Love to paint on them.</p>
<p>Life is durty and hugly, while being beautiful on that condition.
Thank you “God”, for being contradictory, but contradictions are part of
what is the real Truth between everything.</p>
<p>The truth is on the limits… in that small line, where you are
nowhere, while in each side of your, you are somewhere.</p>
