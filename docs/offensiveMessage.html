      <p>Since they don't pay attention to what I say, I will be offensive to them. Is a bad technique, but with <a href="./awesome_story.html">awesome</a> results. <br> 
      Are you Stupid? The Monkey ask very loud. Even those who were not between the conversation, stop and look to the monkey, who question using words to alert, those who are not paying attention. And the Monkey say: Why you are looking to me, the Question was not for you, but you can answer too.<br>  Does the monkey was offensive? No, he did ask if you are stupid, he didn't declare you are stupid. Did you went to school to learn about the difference between a declaration and a question? </p>
      <p>Like any child would do, even if is necessary against their own or against anyone, the child ask: Are You Stupid? <br> Don't react, since is a question, not an afirmation. And even if it was an afirmation, since words don't change reality, you should only ask if you are in doubt about your position in the subject.<br> Are you in doubt about of your stupidity? Then You may ask something or just be offended for nothing. </p>
      <p>The Monkey say: "Dragons are like flowers, they are so fragile that any monkey can eat them alive." </p>
      <p>And a Child answer: "Is what a Korean restaurant use to define that <a href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Love/index.html">Love</a>." </p>
      <p>How they describe it? Ask the Monkey </p>
      <p>"Eat what you Love." the child said </p>
      <p>So the Monkey ask: Did they have Dragons? Because I LOVE Dragons!!</p>
