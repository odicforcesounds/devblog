      <p>Since they don't pay attention to what I say, I will be offensive to them. Is a bad technique, but with <a href="./awesome_story.html">awesome</a> results. Are you Stupid? The Monkey ask very loud. Even those who were not between the communication of conversation, stop and look to the monkey, who did use some stupid words to alert, those who are not paying attention. Does the monkey was offensive? No, he did ask if you are stupid, he didn't declare you are stupid. Did you went to school to learn about the difference between a declaration and a question? </p>
      <p>Like any child would do, even if is necessary against their own or against anyone, the child ask: Are You Stupid? Don't react, since is a question, not an afirmation. </p>
      <p>And even if it was an afirmation, since words don't change reality, you should only ask if you are in doubt about your position in the subject. Are you in doubt about of your stupidity? Then You may ask something or just be offended for nothing. </p>
      <p>The child on me say: Dragons are like flowers, they are so fragile that any monkey can eat them alive. Is what a Korean restaurant use to define that love. "Eat what you love." So the Monkey ask: Did you have Dragons? Because I LOVE Dragons!!</p>
