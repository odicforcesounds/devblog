      <p>This article aim to touch details that are part of the simplistic flow of life.</p>
      <p>I don't like the "dark side of creativity of human mind", since that side focus on destroying lifes.</p>
      <p>So, I will talk about the positive examples, since the bad, have nothing to teach, if not only, what they archive.</p>
      <p>Technologies are growing, fast. As fast as the probabilities of having new "discoveries" when many focus their time to find, by reading, testing and learning, from the mistakes they had. Software upgrades, go into that direction, and rational-living beings should do the same. So, Japan and China are more or less the examples that they develop, to be useful in a positive perspective of "what to do with the knowledge we have?" Well, at least in the positive approach, both did create solutions to simplify problems that exist, in everyones mind, like for example having some robot that serve our food or drinks. We don't need to "deal" with someones irregularities to have eat or drink something. In this example, duality is present, since dealing with others irregularities teach us about our self's, about other's selfs, about Timming and Mindsets, teach us about so many things, that we should deny that functionality for public spaces. But yeah, the Virus developed by the ones who develop all horrible things in this world ( a few good ), made that possibily, the best choice.</p>
      <p>In the perspective of a "Correct God Will", scientists that develop all the bad things, are Guilty! </p>
      <p>If I was some god, I wouldn't condend you for eternity to some horrible experience, but is up to you in what you believe, so who cares right?</p>
      <p>Anyway, China and Japan are part of this "Flow" where the good and the bad are part of the same. Like America and All others are and be.</p>
      <p>It is a common aspect embedded in the education that for others to believe in something, without giving them the opportunity to find by themselfs, IF they point their attention to that subject, else is almost impossible to have that experience. </p>
