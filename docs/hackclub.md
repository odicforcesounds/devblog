# Hack Club Tribute

[Hackclub](https://github.com/orgs/hackclub/) is the example I would like to have, as a test enviorment to my [application](./app_dev.md). 

I try to send them a propose of "help", but I need to wait two more weeks to have an answer. 

They are creative in the names they use. 

We can see [this](https://github.com/hackclub/dns) repository how creative they are in **DNS** names. 

They have [this](https://github.com/hackclub/hcb) documents that target me as a creative person, who may be interested. 

They try to [teach](https://github.com/hackclub/sprig) in a fanny way, which is how education should be for all, in all eternity. 

They [Dream](https://github.com/hackclub/daydream) like me and like you do. 

They like [Dinosaurs](https://github.com/hackclub/dinosaurs) since they are not alive, or they feel like. :) 

They like Led Zeppelin or AC/DC, since the names are [High](https://github.com/hackclub/highway)

They like Tools and Boxes. 

That is how they [deal](https://github.com/hackclub/toolbox) with all problems, like the **Social Tool Kit** do.

Like me, they are in a [Journey](https://github.com/hackclub/journey).

They like [news](https://github.com/hackclub/newspaper) without paper. 

They [apply](https://github.com/hackclub/apply) the same rules for all. 

They like to make [remixes](https://github.com/hackclub/remix) with young people. 

They like "Open Source" :-)
