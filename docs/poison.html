      <p>So, Tabaco that industry produce is Poison. Not Really tabaco, have at least 70 BAD ingredients to smoke and statistics speak about a big amount of Deaths. <br>
      <b>We Don't want your poison</b>
      </p>
      <p>So, pure drugs, don't kill like real poison do, but can kill if you are compulsive on that abuse. In the name of money, we can introduce something that is not supposed to be, to make more money on selling (something(can be drugs or drinks)) to be possible to sell more. I only like Weed and some Haxixe. (the soft drugs in the world (that give more or less the same effect that Tabaco and Alcohol do)) <br>
      When I try all CBD (Cannabis Commercial Versions), I feel (this is poison) .. The same with Commercial Tabaco, comparing to what Pure Tabaco is. Less Poison, because is NATURAL. 
      So we say again <b>We Don't want your poison</b>
      </p>
      <p>Guns is something that become very popular these days, while guns can only kill living beings. So we can say again: <br>
      <b>We Don't want your poison</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the name of the Money, in the name of Popularity, you chose who will represent you. </p>
      <p>The only person that represent each is each not someone else. Oh Politics manipulating everything else.. So we can say again: <br> 
      <b>We Don't want your poison</b></p>
      <p>So I think, since America is a Big Country that have a lot of Rich people, maybe the Quality of those drugs are not good and then Trump said: "This is poison", which in that perspective I agree, if that is the case. </p>
      <p>By history, many Rich persons Love Cocaine. You become (feel like) you are a Super Hero and You are able to do anything, in control of everything. So, normally Rich people like to spend their Money buying this Drug. And the crimes that happen in between, happen mainly because You (Trump) and all others, did care to control. But I guess that is what I expect from America, since the same happen with Guns, while you see Guns as something useful (since you can kill other living beings really fast) and those who are simply enjoying their life with drugs (which with control you control how many doses each can take, and IF there is some psychologic issue that the persons is facing, you can deal with that better), is what you deny to accept. But is not only you, is just a big part of History, while all drugs that Farmacy use, come from the same source, while Farmacy elements are the ones who can create new drugs. Expell Farmacy from USA, and all the knowledge developed in that direction, and you solve that little problem that you deny to deal.</p>
      <p>You see, is easy to deal with what we don't like, just by <a href="./tryingToFixJustice.html">ignoring</a> it, like you could do against all manifestations, like you can do against all provocations, while if they happen, they are a "warning note" about what you are not doing correctly. So don't see manifestations as something bad, see them as positive, because they tell you what you need to change to become better. And to become better you only need to control better what you already control to control more. </p>
      <p>The big Poison in Life, it is in the moment we decide something, without thinking about our choices.</p>
      <p>Justice: (A potencial instrument of education) -> Include Guns as a tool to create justice... ( no more education ) </p>
      <p>Justice: (A potencial instrument of education) -> Include Death Penalties as a tool to create justice... ( no more education ) </p>
