# Hard decisions

I don't like to expose criminal activity against my sites, 
but when is annoying, I have no other choice. 

I really try to redirect attacks to my sites to [this](./mar.md) page, 
but after more than 1 week, I decided to redirect all attacks to some police service,
while that is too strong, I decide to redirect them to my own GitHub repository. 

This decision is based on the [false](./false_hood.md) idea of having a lot of visit. 

KISS: Keep it Stupid Simple 

Click using the mouse, don't try to use tools to attack this sites. 

There is nothing more than what is exposed: No Databases, No Users, No Emails, No dedicated-servers, etc.. 

Pure text, sometimes backgrounds and music.
