# Comparing Linux Distros

I have some experience using Debian and Gentoo for many years. But this last year I try Arch for the first time. Gentoo is the **Best** if we are focusing how many RAM uses and how this RAM is freeded when applications are terminated. In the other hand, Debian and Arch use SystemD by default and it consume a little bit more Memory. For example, the minimal instalation from Debian and Arch, use about 200/300MB without using some extra software. We just login and we open **HTOP** to see how much memory is using, while we could use the `free -m` command, just to see how much memory the OS is using. The same example using **Gentoo**, we will see something like: 70MB. But when we compile software, it will consume a little bit less than any other pre-compiled software. Something I didn't realize for long time, is that Arch have the AUR's repositories, which enable us to compile software from the source. And is always a big big difference. I love to use NChat, a terminal chat-software for Telegram and Whatsapp, and when I compile it it use about 200MB while when installing from pre-compiled sources, it consume about 500MB. Sadly if a user don't update Gentoo every month, the user will have a big big big problem when trying to update, after some months or years. By this aspect, Gentoo is the **Bad** while Debian is the **Good**, even if software compatibility is big, Arch linux is the **Ugly**.
