<h2 class="title3">Thinking Linux</h2>
<p>Me as a <a href="./blog/index.md">Linux user</a> I always like to
understand how servers work and what I need to do to configure a server,
while my internet usage is lower, since I am a big fan of <a
href="./blog/newsboat/urls.md">RSS</a> protocol, which give me the
opportunity to read almost everything without using a <a
href="./blog/linux/w3m.md">web browser</a>. Most of the time the
activity of my computers, are using <a
href="./blog/linux/tmux.md">Tmux</a>, <a
href="./blog/linux/mutt.md">Mutt</a>, <a
href="./blog/linux/irssi.md">Irssi</a>, <a
href="./blog/linux/calcurse.md">Calcurse</a>, <a
href="./blog/linux/git.md">Git</a>, <a
href="./blog/linux/tut.md">Tut</a>, <a
href="./blog/linux/nvm.md">NVM</a> to install NodeJS as a user, <a
href="./blog/linux/pandoc.md">Pandoc</a> to convert Markdown files to
HTML, <a href="./blog/linux/vim.md">Vim</a> that become my daily editor,
some <a href="./blog/linux/rust.md">Rust</a> useful projects, and some
others, using <a href="./blog/linux/python.md">Python</a>. I rarely
login in platforms, I rarely use social-networks. I even use another
awesome application called <a
href="https://github.com/d99kris/nchat">NChat</a> to run inside
<strong>Tmux</strong>. <a
href="./blog/linux/wpa_supplicant.md">WPA-Supplicant</a> if I need to
use some public Wifi, which is very rare to happen, the amazing <a
href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a> using <a
href="./blog/linux/ffmpeg.md">ffmpeg</a> to convert videos on audios,
and <a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv</a> to listen audios, playing videos
and listening to online radios.</p>
<p>Having a dedicated server is another topic, while Cloudflare offer
the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared">cloudflared</a>
application, to create a tunnel between their servers and my private
webserver. This can be a <a href="./blog/awesome/README.md">awesome</a>
way to at least, own the data and own the server for only, Electricity
cost + Internet cost. Then I start to investigate, what I need to have a
<a href="./blog/linux/permissions.md">secure</a> host, beside the
Firewall features that Cloudflare already offer for free, to registered
users who own a domain, and naturally, to all developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> can be a good approach,
while I always like the old fashion of a <a
href="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker">Nginx</a>
server or <a
href="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker">Apache</a>.
A <a
href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted">Self
Hosted</a> application is awesome, while having the server outside home
and have the Admin-Panel running at home, by my will, is another good
approach. Then the server have no Login-Form on Internet, and therefor,
the attack surfice is lower.</p>
<p>I find amazing projects at GitHub with all kind. <a
href="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Fail2Ban-Blacklist-JAIL-for-Repeat-Offenders-with-Perma-Extended-Banning">Fail2Ban</a>
is a known software for servers, to block what they call “offenders”,
which is malicious activity from random users using automatic scripts,
or people who know more about how to think, can find <a
href="./blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/ABBT.md">bugs</a> in the
code, to be able to hack the code, while my side needs to think about
the other side of the attack, which is focused on <a
href="./blog/awesome/files/Security/Defensive/ASH.md">Security</a>
techniques to prevent all kind of <a
href="./blog/awesome/files/Security/Defensive/ATDH.md">Security</a>
issues.</p>
<p>In this investigation I found that even <strong>Google</strong> do
some <a
href="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Stop.Google.Analytics.Ghost.Spam.HOWTO">SPAM</a>
and there is a <a
href="https://github.com/Phishing-Database/Phishing.Database">Phishing
Database</a>. O_o</p>
<p>I personally use in my Linux computers, the <a
href="https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts">StevenBlack</a> hosts or for
a <strong>paranoid</strong> situation the <a
href="https://github.com/Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist/Ultimate.Hosts.Blacklist">Ultimate-Host-Blacklist</a>,
which are projects that are regulary updated.</p>
<p>My web surf is cleaner and I feel better.</p>
