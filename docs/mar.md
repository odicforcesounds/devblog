### Malicious Activities Report

```

- I can read all your requests after they reach the hosting site, which is this one. :)
- The service I use, [log](./blog/awesome/files/Security/Defensive/ATDH.md) your activity, just to know how many visits I get, while this is useful to know who is trying to [attack](./blog/awesome/files/Security/Defensive/ASH.md) my sites. 
- I notice about **Ireland**, **Japan**, **Ukraine**, **Russia**, **Australia** and **France** malicious activity, that is trying to [hack](./blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/AR.md) my sites. 
- From **UK**, **North America** to others, the [Hacking](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/tracks/12_Hacking_Festival/index.html) techniques are different, while all my sites, are **static** and have no input-box to inject code, databases or users. 
- Pure HTML & CSS Only. There are some iframes from [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com) to listen the music I made. I know the music is not awesome, but what can I say?
    - I can add the [security](./blog/awesome/files/Virtualization/DCS.md) headers to accept iframes from this specific domain only too. 
- I am sure that is possible to [hack](./blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/AHSE.md) it, but hopefully no one will. 
- Maybe you already know that I use [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com/) to manage [DNS](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035)  and other [HTTP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616) requests, so I redirect them to [this](https://blog.odicforcesounds.com/blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/ABBT.html) page, to motivate them to learn more. 
- What ever [IP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc791) you use, what every country or continent you are, the rules are applied for all. (Fair)
    - You know, this [attackers](./blog/awesome/files/Github/GCS.md) use some Tool to hack [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) frameworks, without reading the [code](./blog/awesome/files/Develop/APIs/AAD.md), that is accessible from the web browser. :D  
    - I don't know why, but I don't like [PHP](https://www.php.net/). 
    - I Like [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS). 
    - [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) can be useful and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) can be useful too. 
- Well, in fact this specific sub-domain is made with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) only and hosted in **GitHub**, like all other sub-domains.
- I have no secrets for you:
    - **Tip**: See for Yourself the **Source Code** of all sites [here](https://github.com/odicforcesounds)
- To change sites content, you need to commit the changes in each site repository, while if you read the **README** of **Art** sub-domain repository, you see that your contributions are welcome.
    - While if you have [machine](./blog/awesome/files/Linux/Tools/AT.md) power, you can DDoS [Microsoft](https://Microsoft.com), then [GitHub](https://GitHub.com) and CloudFlare that store this website in cache. 
    - After this 3 domains offline, my websites will be offline too, but the site will be at [Archive](https://archive.org) too. :) 
    - I see a lot of work for you, to [hack](./blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/APCS.md) me. 
    - I am not so big that diserve your time for nothing. 
    - But you are the one who knows what to do with your own time. Good Luck!
- I could try to [hack](./blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/RSC.md) you too, since I have your **IP**, and you are using [Windows](https://www.exploit-db.com/?type=remote&platform=windows_x86-64), but I don't spend my time, [fighting against someone](https://blog.odicforcesounds.com/style_of_god.html), but by building [something new](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Dao/login/index.html) for everyone.
