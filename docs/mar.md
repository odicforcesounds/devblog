- In fact, some Ireland guy, is all single days demonstrating to me, that he is ~~my best fan~~. The guy use the same script several times per day. The most curious behavior from this guy is how much he doesn't understand what he is doing.

- From **UK**, **North America** to others, the [Hacking](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/tracks/12_Hacking_Festival/index.html) techniques are different, while all my sites, are **static** and have no input-box to inject code, databases or users. 
- Pure HTML & CSS Only. There are some iframes from [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com) to listen the music I made. I know the music is not awesome, but what can I say?
    - I can add the [security](./blog/notes.md) headers to accept iframes from this specific domain only too. 
- I am sure that is possible to [hack](./blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/AHSE.md) it, but hopefully no one will.

- What ever [IP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc791) you use, what ever continent you are, the rules are applied for all. (Fair)
    - You know, this [attackers](./blog/awesome/files/Github/GCS.md) use some Tool to hack [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) frameworks, without reading the [code](./blog/awesome/files/Develop/APIs/AAD.md), that is accessible from the web browser. :D  
    - I don't know why, but I don't like [PHP](https://www.php.net/). No Logic reason is true. 
    - I Like [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS). 
    - [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) can be useful and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) can be useful too. 
- Well, in fact this specific sub-domain is made with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) only and hosted in **GitHub**, like all other sub-domains.
- I have no secrets for you. **Tip**: See for Yourself the **Source Code** of all sites [here](https://github.com/odicforcesounds)
- To change sites content, you need to commit the changes in each site repository, while if you read the **README** of **Art** sub-domain repository, you see that your contributions are welcome. In case you wish to share a comment, please give it [here](https://github.com/orgs/odicforcesounds/discussions/5). 
    - While if you have [machine](./blog/awesome/files/Virtualization/DCS.md) power, you can DDoS [Microsoft](https://Microsoft.com) that owns [GitHub](https://GitHub.com) and CloudFlare that store this website in cache, while I manage your requests.  
    - After this 3 domains offline, my websites will be offline too, but the site will be at [Archive](https://archive.org) too. :) 
    - I already replicate the code in different code-hostings. 
    - I see a lot of work for you, to [hack](./blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/APCS.md) me. 
    - I am not so big that diserve your time for nothing. 
    - But you are the one who knows what to do with your own time. Good Luck!
- I could try to [hack](./blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/RSC.md) you too, since I have your **IP** and you are using [Windows](https://www.exploit-db.com/?type=remote&platform=windows_x86-64), but I don't spend my time [fighting against someone](https://blog.odicforcesounds.com/style_of_god.html), but by building [something new](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Dao/login/index.html) for everyone.
- In the end, you can even clone all my repositories, and open a pull request with some new code.
- Be Creative.
