### Malicious Activities Report 

- **Note**: I notice about **Ireland**, **Japan** and **France** malicious activity, that is trying to hack my sites. 
- From **UK** to others, the [Hacking](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/tracks/12_Hacking_Festival/index.html) techniques, are different, while all my sites, are **static** and have no input-box to inject code. 
- I am sure that is possible to hack it, but hopefully no one will. 
- Maybe you already know that I use **Cloudflare** to manage **DNS** and other **HTTP** inputs, so I redirect them to [this](https://blog.odicforcesounds.com/blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/ABBT.html) page, to motivate them to learn more. 
    - You know, they use some automatic **Script-Kid** Tool to hack **Wordpress** / **PHP** frameworks. 
    - I don't know why, but I don't like **PHP**. 
    - I Like [HTML](./blog/web/html.md) and [CSS](./blog/web/css.md). 
    - [JavaScript](./blog/web/javascript.md) can be useful and [NodeJS](./blog/web/nodejs.md) can be useful too. 

- Well, in fact this specific sub-domain is made with **Markdown** only and hosted in **GitHub**, like all other sub-domains. 
- I have no secrets for you:
- To change the sites, you need to commit the changes in each site repository. :)
    - **Cool Tip**: See for Your self the **Source Code** of all sites [here](https://github.com/odicforcesounds/Art)
    - While if you have machine power, you can DDoS Microsoft.com, then GitHub.com and CloudFlare.com that store this website in cache. 
    - After this 3 domains offline, my websites will be offline too, but the site will be at archive.org too. :) 
    - I see a lot of work for you, to hack me. 
    - I am not so big that diserve your time for nothing. 
    - But you are the one who knows what to do with your own time. Good Luck!
