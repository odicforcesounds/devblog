### Malicious Activities Report 

    MIM: I am the Man in the Middle 
    - I can read all your requests before they reach the hosting site, which is this one. :) 

- I notice about **Ireland**, **Japan** **Australia** and **France** malicious activity, that is trying to hack my sites. 
- From **UK**, **North America** to others, the [Hacking](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/tracks/12_Hacking_Festival/index.html) techniques are different, while all my sites, are **static** and have no input-box to inject code. 
- I am sure that is possible to hack it, but hopefully no one will. 
- Maybe you already know that I use [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com/) to manage [DNS](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035)  and other [HTTP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616) requests, so I redirect them to [this](https://blog.odicforcesounds.com/blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/ABBT.html) page, to motivate them to learn more. 
    - You know, they use some automatic **Script-Kid** Tool to hack [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) frameworks. 
    - I don't know why, but I don't like [PHP](https://www.php.net/). 
    - I Like [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS). 
    - [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) can be useful and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) can be useful too. 

- Well, in fact this specific sub-domain is made with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) only and hosted in **GitHub**, like all other sub-domains.
    - **Cool Tip**: See for Yourself the **Source Code** of all sites [here](https://github.com/odicforcesounds)
- I have no secrets for you:
- To change the sites, you need to commit the changes in each site repository. :)
    - While if you have machine power, you can DDoS [Microsoft](https://Microsoft.com), then [GitHub](https://GitHub.com) and CloudFlare that store this website in cache. 
    - After this 3 domains offline, my websites will be offline too, but the site will be at [Archive](https://archive.org) too. :) 
    - I see a lot of work for you, to hack me. 
    - I am not so big that diserve your time for nothing. 
    - But you are the one who knows what to do with your own time. Good Luck!
