### Malicious Activities Report 

**Note**: I notice about melicious **Ireland** activity, that is trying to hack my sites. From **UK** to others, the [Hacking](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/tracks/12_Hacking_Festival/index.html) techniques, are different, while all my sites, are static and have no input-box to inject code. I am sure that is possible to hack it, but hopefully no one will. Maybe you already know that I use **Cloudflare** to manage **DNS** and other **HTTP** inputs, so I redirect them to [this](https://blog.odicforcesounds.com/blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/ABBT.html) page, to motivate them to learn more. You know, they use some automatic **Script-Kid** Tool to hack **Wordpress** / **PHP** frameworks. I don't know why, but I don't like **PHP**. I Like [HTML](./blog/web/html.md) and [CSS](./blog/web/css.md). [JavaScript](./blog/web/javascript.md) can be useful and [NodeJS](./blog/web/nodejs.md) can be useful too. Well, in fact this specific sub-domain is made with **Markdown** only and hosted in **GitHub**.
