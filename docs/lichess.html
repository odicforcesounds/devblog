      <p>Naturally you need to know how to play. After that you need to understand the organic of pieces, what changes happen in small movements and how difficult is to calculate everything. I am not so good playing chess, but I found this <a target="_blank" "https://lichess.org">Popular Online Chess game</a> called "Li", where I see how much I am not paying attention. Is like a way to see how much my attention is not focusing correctly, while I know that the best players, already know a lot of games, where they memorize the pieces places and even then, they did study, like someone whos studing for being something that is, in this specific example, playing chess.</p>
      <p>
I think Soldiers around the world should know how to win many chess games, before getting a gun. Well, and all the wars could happen like that, in a Chess table, where no one die, without the desire to fight against someone, mainly because they have a gun. Like all kind of games / practices, the more we practice the more we know, but don't refuse to study and read about it, since it helps a lot, more than the experience of many games. This is the fairest war game human can have. Pure logic, while being fairplay. Else, we can ask the representants of each country that is in war, to be in a box ring, to fight against other country leader. In actual wars there is a big waste of lifes, while using this technique, only the leaders who agree in wars, would be there, fighting the other leader. Or just use the big amount of space that exist on Earth, to put together all soldiers, away of any other living being, and fight there, aways from the civilians, for the same values, saving the lifes you swere the save, or don't go into the war and stay with the ones you love, since that is the most important decision you can do to save the ones you love.
      </p>
      <p>Never mind, just die or kill for no reason at all, in the name of some superiority, named into the infinite of this finit life. If you are a representant of any government, please continue to do everything you did wrong in history, since for all this centuries of experiencing the same, you didn't learn nothing with it. :) </p>
      <p>I am glad that Palestine and Israel are in Peace. I mean, that conflict have too many centuries.. too many generations killing and dying for nothing. Their daeth were not the function that could solve the problem. As I like to say: <a href="./style_of_god.html">God</a> doesn't care if humanity pass all eternity killing each others of making sex in a compulsive way, and he Gave us the <b>Free Will of Choice</b>. So at least for me and in my <a href="./about_me.html">small</a> experience of Life, God exist and that is the reason and the condition of <b>everything being possible</b>, like it is, as we can see in the news so many times in history that we think: did they learn the lesson or they are just reproducing it again? I guess is true, that countries around the world, in History, are repeating everything again... So they didn't learn the lesson. </p>
      <p>All lands are Sacret and all Walls create laments. They are obcessed with one single place that represent, what everyone understand, far away from their sacret land. Is about possession of is about meaning? :) If is about possession, is about "Their land", if is about meaning, is about something deeper than a piece of land in this Unique Planet, where all the Lands are Sacred! </p>
