    <h1 class="title1">Why should I ask help in some community?</h1>

    <div class="textbox">
      <!--       BODY -->
      <p>AI, is destroying this sense of community that we develop the last years, asking for help, while the readers, make questions to give a better answer or to correct the things we didn't express very well. But now with AI, the helper understand what we say and give us some good suggestions to start learning something or start solving some problem.</p>
      <p>Even if we know that AI is made by users, who share data and who design the software that AI is, like any brain can be, specific in skills that ask knowledge, by the same condition that computers need, to gain speed on doing something: repetition, this AI revolution can be a little bit tricky, since AI show it self a bit "human", in that aspect of having no limitation of subject or intentional will. The will to control "something" and the will to destroy "something", the will to help in "something", the will to inform about "something". That is the <b>Common will</b> between all other Human Beings! The Will that is getting lost, since AI can help in communication, without being emotive. O_o</p>
      <p>Yes, the aspect of how each feel, can create confusion about what we learn, while that is just another trick, that the mind need to learn. You know, is like that teacher that use some specific configuration because "he believes" that is the correct one, and even if that "perfect configuration" is not perfect for all cases, we make the same choice, just because that teacher inspire us.. so yes, inspirations are reflections of emotions as all other behaviors that can be impulsive, but that is what the mind needs to learn to deal with.</p>
      <p>I really like schools that are a open space to creative and creation of "all" (excluding destructive ones(very popular this days)) subjects, to be, what ever the mind wish to archive, using what we know that is needed to develop the "dream" in reality. Maybe schools are "wasting the time of students" in that aspect, that block their time to create. I mean, I child can dream about being a police, while for that she needs to learn a big amount of informations that schools give, but to archive the dream case (being police), is not necessary to consume another amount of information that a police don't need to develop. Because, when we are focusing in what we like to develop, we are much more able to learn, even stuff that is not about the main subject. Is part of that "imaginative flow" that each have, which make possible, to create and "walk the path". That "path" of human history, was focused mainly in something that is impossible to archive, which is God, in the sense of being With, in a eternal state of conscience, which did result in people giving their life for no reason, since their death didn't contribute to solve the problem, but we can always focus in reality and with that, we can create much more... </p>
