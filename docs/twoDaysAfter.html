      <p>As I describe in <a href="./theBestApproach.html">this</a> article and in the <a href="usedTechniqueIsGood.html">next</a> one, is that I was implmenting a technique to stop Wordpress attacks. If you read those articles you will not find the key of that approach, while reading this one, is obvious because the Title describe it in a explicit way.</p>
      <p>ASNs are like nodes on NodeJS application, to route traffic from one point to another. So, what I had implement are rules based on few conditions that can be fair to few (the attackers) and unfair to many more (users that have no intention to attack), but their traffic comes from the same origins. For example, today (I only had 1 single PHP attack attempt, and all others that probably happen, I was not notify about them, because I redirect them to each one police site of their original country.</p>
      <p>So, if you are from Germany and you attacks pass through a specific ASN, I create a rule that describe: "From Country AND from ASN - Redirect to germanPoliceSite". With that in mind, all attackers that normally don't read the logs of their stupid software made to attack, are redirected to their police sites, which can result in something very cool, which is, being arrested without understanding why. And they will not understand because they don't read the logs, else, attacks couldn't happen from the same IP several times per day. With this approach, most of the countries listed in <a href="./TopAttackerIPs.html">this</a> article, that pass throught a specific ASN node, will not reach my site, but their Loved Police sites. </p>
      <p>I finally describe how and why, to help sysadmins to think if this approach is good for them or not. </p>
      <p>For me is good, mainly because I prefer to have few visitors that follow the links, than having a lot of requests that are false(positives). </p>
