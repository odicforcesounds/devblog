<h1 class="title5">Offended Chinese Girl</h1>
<div class="textbox">
<p>I was for some days to Spain ( Coruña ), and I found that there are a
lot of Chinese stores of different kind. One of them was a liquid
Icescreem with some small-balls inside.</p>
<p>Personally I don’t like to mix liquid stuff with anything that is not
liquid and therefor, when the girl ask me if I like, I said: I don’t
like because I don’t like to mix non-liquid stuff with liquid.</p>
<p>Then I ask her if she can do the same without those Bubble-Crap.. and
she got offended saying: “this is chinese culture and I don’t need to
change it for you”. Then I try to tell her that <strong>The Condition of
adaptability is inevitable, mainly when we leave our origins</strong>.
She answer me that she was speaking in Spanish with me, demonstrating
that she was even more mad with me, which result in calling some other
Chinese man.</p>
<p>I install an application to translate text in chinese and show the
guy what I wish to tell her, and with that attitude of mine, she open
her ears to listen better, as she demonstrate she was able to think
about what I was telling her.</p>
<p>Being Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamite, Brasilian, Spanish, Portuguese,
English, Americanish ( lol ) .. what ever your language is, you should
learn the language of the country you are going to live. And Chinese
normally do, but sometimes they confuse things.</p>
<p>Not only Chinese, but the majority of all restaurants in the world,
they try to adapt the plates to the taste of their clients.</p>
<p>Is not about loosing your culture.. is about trying to satisfy your
clients.</p></div>
