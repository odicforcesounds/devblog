      <p>I guess the majority of GitHub users, clone / fork repositories, but this one create them from scratch. This is not a promotion article, while it is. I am promoting someone that doesn't need promotion, but I follow him for some years. As I like to describe, <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus?">this</a> guy write JavaScript in the same level he speak English, while being much more active than me. I mean, I don't know JavaScript as he does, while I like to write some posts, here or there, this guy writes much more than me. I am not trying to compete. I just like to appreciate his cretitivy while using logic. But if you explore this user repos, you will see that is not only JavaScript, but TypeScript, Swift, and others. One of the most interesting things I see, is that he doesn't have a pattern of contributions, I mean, his contributions are not made only in "those specific days" he is working. No, this guy don't sleep (joke), this guy don't have a life outside the computer (another joke), this guy, is better than any AI quantum computer. You know why? Because he is human! Oh yeah, he is human! </p>
      <p>There is <a href="https://github.com/Marak">this</a> guy who follow me. I have nothing interesting to share, while this follower have many other JavaScript applications, super interesting to explore and test. He is just another guy who speak JavaScript in the same level he writes English. Probably there are many more like this two, but I am not spying users, while I can when exploring Repos.</p>
