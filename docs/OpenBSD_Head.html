      <p>Here on this Blog, I already wrote about <a href="./openSecurity.html">OpenBSD</a> features or about some <a href="./whoTheyAre.html">OpenBSD</a> Developers, while I was ignoring the Head of this project. What open my curiosity was a declaration that is interesting to think: "<b>Linux people do what they do because they hate Microsoft. We do what we do because we love Unix</b>".</p>
      <p>After reading and thinking about the Probability of this declarations being a bit true, I feel that I should investigate more about this gentleman. Then I when to his site and I got Surprised. I feel like: This is not what I was expecting to see.</p>
      <p>No, but at same time, make sense to me. This guy LOVE nature, and like to walk with his friend (being lover or not(it doesn't matter for me)). I really like to see, those pictures full of Natural colors, with Natural Irregularities, like some reptiles that are there, to demonstrate you how Unpredictability is created and how Beutiful that system that have no Control or Security features is.</p>
      <p>This aspect is not something common from all other Unix / Linux users, since the majority would only show their Code abilities and some "work" that they did in Time. I really hope that  Theo de Raadt keep doing those long walks, because is one of the best exercises that anyone can do, while sometimes <a href="./pharmacDrugs.html">Irregularities</a> happen and life demonstrate itself, stronger than us, which is Logic, since we are not <a href="./style_of_god.html">Gods</a>.</p>
