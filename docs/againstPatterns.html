      <p>Because I really <a href="./excitedMoments.html">fascinated</a> with these people, here is a obvious challenge for your skills. I am using Wordpress to host this sites. I change change the directories that exist by default. Naturally, all your pussy scripts, fail because they are searching for the "default paths". Since I believe that you are a bit intelligent, possibly, you can try to find those paths and define them in your little program that is not yours. After all you just copy and execute, like others do when they copy as paste. Without thinking what they are doing, just repeating. You look like a <a href="./japaneseDog.html">Dog</a> but don't worry, since humans behave more or less the same, while if Dogs are not intelligent and can find new unkown paths, for you it will be super easy, because I want to believe that you are more intelligent that dogs. Show me you are.</p>
