<h1 class="title2">The Style of God</h1>
<p>Imagination(<strong>Abstraction</strong>) <strong>+</strong>
Logic(<strong>Rationality</strong>) <strong>=</strong>
Application(<strong>Philosophy</strong>)</p>
<p>Which means: 1 + 1 = 1 OR 3 道 (Dao/Tao)</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Dao/index.html">Dao</a>
is the Path, and the <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Dao_Expression/tracks/03_Path_of_the_Sun_Keepers/index.html">Path</a>
is simple.</p>
<p>Then we have the <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Tao/index.html">Tao</a>,
which is the condition.</p>
<p>The condition is not always easy, but by the illusion to archive it,
is possible.</p>
<p>Our ability to imagine is based on what we know. That is how we
create new ideas, positive or false, but possible to create them in
reality, as a image, text or static object, while this days, objects can
move and even talk, with A.I. What ever is the Logic Path we select, we
will create an expression with that, which is the <a
href="https://wiki.odicforcesounds.com">Application</a>.</p>
<p>Old knowledge that make sense to me, while the principles of
creation, being part of what we can imagine, is based on the concept of
<strong>Maya</strong> from <strong>Hinduism</strong>, and is in fact as
well, part of how <strong>Zen Schools</strong> select their students.
The selection is based on what students can imagine, sharing all their
capacities to interpret the world. This is one of the main reasons I
<strong>love</strong> Asian cultures and literature, while there are
many others that use the same technique to educate some values. The
definition of what each can imagine, is not given by the author as
something concrete and objective, but something that doesn’t depend on
the author, but in the ability of the reader, to imagine.</p>
<p>This describe what we can see in any community around the globe. Like
all books are, while some books, become like “technical books”, creating
in individuals the need to see in reality, what is described in those
books, like the <strong>Bible</strong>, <strong>Quran</strong>,
<strong>Torah</strong> and others, do to their followers, explaining all
conflicts that exist in history, about this <strong>psychologic</strong>
event, that even scientists “suffer” from. What <strong>Science</strong>
could do without the ability to imagine, based on the knowledge each
individual have?</p>
<p>Is curious that all religious and spiritual books, point to one
single human <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Path_Of_Shields/tracks/03_The_Possession_of_Will/index.html">characteristic</a>
that make possible to any human, to create change, solutions and
conflicts. Is a characteristic that enable us to <strong>Walk the
Path</strong> of what our mind is focus in, like <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Only_Tributes/tracks/03_Bruce_Lee/index.html">Bruce
Lee</a> would say.</p>
<p><strong>About Freedom</strong>: The flower in the garden can be seen
by anyone. This means that the flower in the garden is from everyone. In
the moment that someone wish to possess this flower and remove it from
the garden, conflicts start, because everyone can feel the same, in the
basic aspect of what <strong>possession</strong> aims to have.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: Palestine cannot be owned by
“someone”, and by that condition, is from everyone. Like everything in
this life should be, so we could leave in peace for eternity.</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: Christ was victimized for saying the
“Truth”, while many others in reality are. God is
<strong>Absolute</strong>, and absolute means, everything and everyone.
Everyone interpretation of God can be true and false at the same time.
Did you learn the lesson or you are just repeating the mistake?</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: Only Islam is perfect, the Quran
say. To those who want <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Deep_Random_Meanings/tracks/06_Perfection/index.html">perfection</a>,
please go into that perfect land, and leave those cultures that
contradict with yours, or embrace the new, is what anyone can do, to
live in peace, within any community, is by believing and sharing, those
commum and cultural practices together.</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: To win the Storm, we need to leave
the storm way. Else, the storm will take us, and make us feel that we
are the storm, while we are just a <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Dao_Touch/tracks/07_Fragments_You_Need/index.html">fragment</a>
of it.</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: Solipsism is a false Philosopical
theory, but we all live in that condition.</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: The Unique <strong>Divine</strong>
characteristic we all have is the <strong>Will</strong>. Without it,
nothing is done, nothing is created, nothing can change.</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: If you tell a lie about me, I will
not get offended. If you tell some truth that I <strong>wish to hide
from everyone</strong>, I will get offended. So many people putting
others in Court, by being offended, while the Justice system defend
them. Question: Is my impression or the Justice system is getting
corrupted, because they don’t think about how the brain works? Those who
get offended are hiding something, when someone just declare in a verbal
way, some situation about the other. Naturally we can feel offended by
many other conditions, like for example this days, when someone record a
video that focus us, while we are not “public stars”, while they don’t
know us, while they didn’t ask us if they can record, but you can see
for your self, similar examples that people get offended because they
wish to hide something. This means only two possible Truth’s. The one
who feel offended, didn’t solve small things inside of “him”, while
demonstrating being offended, is a auto-declaration of some “issue”,
that can be the true in the self, which points to something else. The
best technique to fight against what can be offensive, is to embrace it
as true, by accepting it, or just by ignoring, pointing our minds to
something else.</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: The Christian say: My book speak
about the truth and all others, don’t, while all others say the same
from all others. Are you serious or you are just competing?</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: Words don’t change reality. You are
gay! You don’t become gay just because I say. The world is a rectangle.
The world doesn’t change it’s form, just because I say it. You are the
most intelligent person in the world. No, You don’t become the most
intelligent person in the world, just because I say it. I am a <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Shamanic_Quest_Dream/tracks/10_Press_for_Monkey/index.html">Monkey</a>.
No, I feel like a Monkey but I am a human. Transsexual persons feel they
are woman, but they are men. etc… Words don’t change reality and
everything we think we are, is part on our ability to Imagine, so we can
create a similar version of what we can think we can be, without being.
Is almost like the idea of man who want to be like God, they can feel
they are, but they aren’t.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: “God is good but kill us all. The
Devil is bad, but make us laught.” God is good, when God knows how to
deal with denials. God is bad, when react to those who deny His will.
You are not a god, but you can behave like one. This is the most
important lessons from the Bible. The “good”, become bad when reacting
to those who deny their will and the “bad”, become good, when someone
punish them, just because they deny someone else will. How many persons
in history, punish others, just because they deny others will? Just open
the newspaper and see for yourself, more examples. So You didn’t learn
the lesson. You keep repeating the mistake. If you want to be like a
God, you need to go into the Military services and be in the higher
position. Then you can make choices and no one can deny them without
being punished. ( what a Joke ) - Human Psychology <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Only_Tributes/tracks/11_Vital_Manipulation/index.html">Manipulation</a>
from old Times until this days.</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: If everything humanity did create,
was based on it’s ability to imagine, then we can assume that God did
create the universe by the same condition, while humanity need to learn
by doing mistakes, God already know how to create without making
mistakes. Based on this idea, we cannot deny God <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/tracks/06_Dominated_by_Time_Ruled_by_Desire/index.html">existence</a>.
God is dreaming about me while did create me. The same about you. <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/tracks/01_We_Came_in_Peace/index.html">We
Came in Peace</a></li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: Justice systems are shown to be what
represents the <strong>Good</strong> intention, and when others deny it,
represented as the <strong>Bad</strong> intention. Jesus Christ was the
<strong>Bad</strong> to the eyes of the Justice system that was ruling
his time, and therefor was cruxified. The <strong>Good</strong> become
the <strong>Bad</strong> and the <strong>Bad</strong> become
<strong>Good</strong>. The same idea is given by <strong>God
Will</strong> and the <strong>Devil Will</strong>. A story for children,
that try to explain how humans react to those who deny each one will,
while the description of it, produce the same effect to some followers.
But this lesson is older than Jesus Christ. The lesson aims to educate
for the importance of Self Discipline, which anyone is able to use,
using their own mind to abstract the effect, to be able to don’t react.
Basic Psychology issue. What the text describe is not about the future,
but about what already happen, while Lovers, will feed the need to
create in reality what is expressed in Books, like many others do.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: In Islamic countries, man rape
woman, just because they show them self’s as they are. By natural
condition of any woman, the vagina produce some fluid to make the
penetration less painful. By this condition, woman body who were rape in
Islam, create this vaginal fluid, and Islamic belief considere that this
woman had pleasure, which result in killing them. Naturally this is a
reality that is not funny at all, while many woman keep accepting this
condition of fragility, denying to see the other part as the problem:
man had an erection and couldn’t control them selfs, even if Quran speak
about the self control. No. This is not a joke, but is better to laught
than to cry, because by logic, this is a sad choice, a sad behavior.
Masturbation can save LIFES! ( or mix genders (AS GOD INTENT TO BE)
naked ) After you see 1000 similar bodies, your input about any woman,
will not be based on the Body, and if it is, now you can control your
self. In a Urgency moment, use your hand if you need extra help.</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: In Sanskript there is nothing that
define what the Castas was for long time. The author of this old texts,
describe different social classes, to be possible to describe economical
reality. I am happy to see that Castas are over, while cultures will
have some difficult to change what is cultural, like all others do. Some
Christian cultures keep killing Oxs for fun, while that doesn’t
demonstrate their superiority. Some cultures did change, as Christians
don’t need to fights against several starving Lions just for Fun.
Sometimes Indian cultures treat bad woman, but that is a common aspect
between many other cultures. Sometimes it looks that they forget that
without woman, we couldn’t be here and therefor the “superior” gender
need to be the femenine, else man would be born from the Anus of their
fathers.</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: This days we have a popular saying
that describe: “Those who speak the Truth, cannot be punished”. This is
where the Christian cultures, demonstrate they did learn the main lesson
of the Bible. In fact, the Justice systems adapt it self, becoming less
unfair and less violent for many centuries to those who say the truth. I
am glad about it.</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: Everyone can be “blessed” when each
one get help by the ones who can help. <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Shamanic_Quest_Dream/tracks/13_Deeds_Path_to_Paradise/index.html">Deeds
- Path of Paradise</a>: In all Human History and Reality and for
Eternity, <strong>Heaven</strong> can exist in reality, as you may see,
that <strong>Hell</strong> exist in reality too. Your choice to create
what you like to see is part as well of reality. In this aspect Islamic
cultures try to solve this problem, while some of them, try to
discriminate those who are poor, like the Hindu do for the
“Untouchable”. You are blessed by the Monkey. Use the brain as best you
can. The monkey is here to help everyone to become better. Lets continue
history in a healthy way, please!</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: The Police could try to be useful
without being corrupt, while paying attention to corruption, is what all
police can get or be. Inside and Outside. For me, the Police should be
just an public informer, nothing more. In this days where Internet exist
and Video-Cams around the world, the Police only need to exchange
information, to have a active duty. No Guns. No Fights. Demonstrate how
Military education was “Good”, and control the self, without reacting,
without denying, accepting what was declared and demonstrating Joy from
that declaration that point to some direction. In the end, you will see
that nothing did change, and you experienced a new sensastion, just by
imagining what ever did say, in the declaration.</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: Military Education could upgrade
their skill’s. Can you change the center of all targets to be the
members of the Body? ( not in the center of the body but outside of the
center of the body: Arms, Legs (exclude Head) but your can include
ears). Is a good challenge for you, and at least you do something a
little bit more difficult. Try to forget what is easy. The creating of
all tools that you have, take more time that any life could even live to
enjoy the creating. Another <strong>COOL</strong> challenge for you all,
is to be able to target persons without killing inocent people. You are
fighting someone like you: ( another Military ) … not someone else that
is NOT a soldier. You could try to improve your <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Shiva_and_Kali_Dance/tracks/03_United_Colors_of_Skeleton/index.html">Skill’s</a>
by shooting “fly’s”. If the Chinese can do it with 2 little wood sticks,
you can do better with Guns.</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: Governments of the World could
invest in Military Wars, outside this planet. The <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Only_Tributes/tracks/09_Two_Sides_One_Force/index.html">Star
Wars</a> can exist. You only need to invest on that, and any military in
the world, will only kill, torture and punish others soldiers that are
there for the same. (Save the Inocents) Imagine how <a
href="./awesome_story.md">AWESOME</a> would be. The World could be
watching the Wars in TV, outside this planet, between any country,
fighting for the same “Values”, for the same “Reasons”, for the same
“Causes”, and for the First Time in History, the Inocents are
saved.</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: This days, as we click a bottom,
military can do the same to attack anyone. Children with 2 years old,
could do the same, just by having access to the action. Imagine a room
full of bottoms in the flour. Each bottom activate a bomb, by send it to
some target. How a child of 2 years old, could destroy all the planet,
just by exploring the room, by walking, while destroying everything
around. Maybe this baby could be the most strong soldier of Earth, with
only two years old, in the perfect condition, to be, what all other
livings beings could do. We can try the same example with a Dog or a
Cat, or a Pig, or a Horse, or a Camel, or a Elephant, or a … All of them
could do the same, of what we see this days, as demonstrations of
“power” from the military forces.</li>
<li><strong>Logic Thought</strong>: The “Testemunhas de Jeova”, which is
a Brasilian religion that doesn’t believe in Life after death, promote
them self’s, by saying that nations are attacking each others, like the
Bible describe. Naturally if any nation is doing anything based on what
the Bible say, nations are attacking each others, because the Book
describe that. Machines don’t question what they read, while humans for
many centuries, did the same. So why the nations are attacking each
others? Because the book describe that, as they adapt them self’s to
what the book say. Maybe only those who did change the descriptions of
the First version of the Bible to the new, knew how humans behave, and
therefor, they change a bit. Christianity was the only religion that
feel the need to become better. For that I give my own congratulations,
as people become more open to help others and by giving the opportunity
to knowledge to demonstrate it’s own power. <strong>Those who fall in
love with a content of any book, will feel the need to see in reality,
what the book describe</strong>. Can be spiritual content or technical.
It doesn’t matter. Is part of how the brain can create in reality what
the book say.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I like to say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let the Heart chose the Path, but use the Brain to walk the <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Shiva_and_Kali_Dance/tracks/08_First_Contact_Path_of_Shields/index.html">Path</a>.</li>
<li>The Heart want to <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Machine_World/tracks/03_Control_Free_to_Ask/index.html">control</a>
everything, to own everything, while by logic, we cannot.”</li>
