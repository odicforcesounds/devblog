      <p>I pass many years trying to say that <a href="./behindTheScenes.html">Military Forces</a> do some silly things in History, while I continue to believe on that, today I had the Luck to speak with someone that knows a bit more about reality and with that, I learn a bit more about few details that I am probably wrong. Mainly when Wars are the subject, mainly if these wars are in Islamic Territories, the probability of having Children and Woman that will use Guns to attack soldiers, is big and with that, I understand why Military behaviorskill all (indiscriminated) who are alive, since any child can kill, any woman can <a href="./hackingJustice.html">kill</a>, and even if only few of them will try, in the moment that the soldier is on the war zone, the adrenaline is so big, that they cannot think and therefor, they will kill all who are alive.</p>
      <p>I really feel Luck, for having the possibility to talk with experienced <a href="./inTheNameOfJustice.html">people</a>, to clear my doubts and clarify my Wrong interpretation of reality, because without that persective that is more realistic than the content that my mind can create only by thinking, what I think I know, is in fact what I my mind is unable to think as a possiblity.</p>
      <p>I understand that behavior, from children, woman, man and soldiers. I don't approve but I understand better now. Is the Sad condition that wars create on those who are active or passive, in any war experience. By mistakes we learn. By being Wrong we learn. By false theories we learn. By bad choices, we learn.</p>
