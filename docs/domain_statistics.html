<h2 id="domain-statistics-7-of-july-2025">Domain statistics: 7 of July
2025</h2>
<p>Last year, the number of visits of the main sub-domain <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com">Art</a> grow, and for the first
time I could rich <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, which in the aspect of how
many visits I get per month, the number is bigger then
<strong>USA</strong>, that was for long time, the first on “how many
visits I have in odicforcesounds.com”.</p>

<p>I feel good to see this results, just because I believe that
<strong>Chinese</strong> will agree about my interpretation of the 道,
which I describe as <a href="./style_of_god.md">The Style of God</a>,
which is all about, what we do, what we create, what we become. I become
a Monkey and I do a lot of reading and writing, even if sometimes I talk
alone. ;)</p>
<p><strong>Ireland</strong> is as well a country that “visit a lot” this
website. I think there is a <strong>Myth</strong> about
<strong>Dragons</strong> in old Ireland cultures. I don’t know why, but
there are a lot of cultures that like <strong>Dragons</strong>, even
<strong>Japan</strong> and many others.</p>
