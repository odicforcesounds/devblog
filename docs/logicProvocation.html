      <p>Before anything, Bots are awesome, mainly to those who have a few fans and the fans are not sharing the work. For that, I am thankful to Bot owners. Anyway, I am here to speak about the <a href="./wordpress_attacks.html">commond</a> and <a href="./againstPatterns.html">redundant</a> attack behaviors of those who are stoped in Time. All your attacks are useless against this site and I think you are stoped in Time, like the <a href="./religions.html">majority</a> is, which is a bit <a href="./theTransformation.html">sad</a>, since all other inventions in the world, continue having improvements and updates or upgrades, for all this last years of developing something, using only, leters, numbers and symbols, like any healthy person need to have or produce, like any computers understand what each one means. <a href="./EthicalLawsOnIT.html">Ethics</a> is deeper than religions or spirituality. Is not politics, while politics use them to manipulate reality. <br> 
      I think my <a href="./linux_comparation.html">Lovers</a> that are from many differrent countries, could understand that, we cannot <a href="./creativeLinux.html">make</a> love with each others, which is good, since you are probably man, and at least for me, I like to be far away from <a href="./theBestLinuxDistro.html">sexual desires</a> with man, being they Japanese, North American, from Indonesia, China, France, Germany and many others, that show their love <a href="./againstPatterns.html">attacking</a> my sites, but since I like to see you failing, I think you are <a href="./blueteam_learning.html">loving</a> it, and therefor you can <a href="./ChristianLinux.html">touch</a> yourself, the way you like, by clicking on <b>OLD and Popular Hacking Software</b>, without following any Ethical principle. <br><br> 
      Personally I enjoy seeing you failing, and You can continue trying your best on that objective, while I will continue having a lot of <a href="./blog/awesome/files/Security/Defensive/ASH.html">Fun</a>. When I see users attacking websites without the ability to see the code of the site, within their own browsers, I question your knowledge. <br>
      <br>
      I am sure you are intelligent, else you wouldn't be able to press any button to attack some sites, but I think you should <a href="./learningbyteaching.html">learn</a> a bit more, don't you think?</p>
      <p class="center">Don't think, Feel. Is like a Finger pointing into the Moon. Don't concentrate on the Finger or you will Fail Again :) </p>
