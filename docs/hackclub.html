<p><a href="https://github.com/orgs/hackclub/">Hackclub</a> is the
example I would like to have, as a test enviorment to my <a
href="./app_dev.md">application</a>.</p>
<p>I try to send them a propose of “help”, but I need to wait two more
weeks to have an answer.</p>
<p>They are creative in the names they use.</p>
<p>We can see <a href="https://github.com/hackclub/dns">this</a>
repository how creative they are in <strong>DNS</strong> names.</p>
<p>They have <a href="https://github.com/hackclub/hcb">this</a>
documents that target me as a creative person, who may be
interested.</p>
<p>They try to <a href="https://github.com/hackclub/sprig">teach</a> in
a fanny way, which is how education should be for all, in all
eternity.</p>
<p>They <a href="https://github.com/hackclub/daydream">Dream</a> like me
and like you do.</p>
<p>They like <a
href="https://github.com/hackclub/dinosaurs">Dinosaurs</a> since they
are not alive, or they feel like. :)</p>
<p>They like Led Zeppelin or AC/DC, since the names are <a
href="https://github.com/hackclub/highway">High</a></p>
<p>They like Tools and Boxes.</p>
<p>That is how they <a
href="https://github.com/hackclub/toolbox">deal</a> with all problems,
like the <strong>Social Tool Kit</strong> do.</p>
<p>Like me, they are in a <a
href="https://github.com/hackclub/journey">Journey</a>.</p>
<p>They like <a href="https://github.com/hackclub/newspaper">news</a>
without paper.</p>
<p>They <a href="https://github.com/hackclub/apply">apply</a> the same
rules for all.</p>
<p>They like to make <a
href="https://github.com/hackclub/remix">remixes</a> with young
people.</p>
<p>They like “Open Source” :-)</p>
