## Thinking Linux

Me as a [Linux user](./blog/index.md) I always like to understand how servers work and what I need to do to configure a server, while my internet usage is lower, since I am a big fan of [RSS](./blog/newsboat/urls.md) protocol, which give me the opportunity to read almost everything without using a [web browser](./blog/linux/w3m.md). Most of the time the activity of my computers, are using [Tmux](./blog/linux/tmux.md), [Mutt](./blog/linux/mutt.md), [Irssi](./blog/linux/irssi.md), [Calcurse](./blog/linux/calcurse.md), [Git](./blog/linux/git.md), [Tut](./blog/linux/tut.md), [NVM](./blog/linux/nvm.md) to install NodeJS as a user, [Pandoc](./blog/linux/pandoc.md) to convert Markdown files to HTML, [Vim](./blog/linux/vim.md) that become my daily editor, some [Rust](./blog/linux/rust.md) useful projects, and some others, using [Python](./blog/linux/python.md). I rarely login in platforms, I rarely use social-networks. I even use another awesome application called [NChat](https://github.com/d99kris/nchat) to run inside **Tmux**. [WPA-Supplicant](./blog/linux/wpa_supplicant.md) if I need to use some public Wifi, which is very rare to happen, the amazing [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) using [ffmpeg](./blog/linux/ffmpeg.md) to convert videos on audios, and [mpv](https://mpv.io/) to listen audios, playing videos and listening to online radios. 

Having a dedicated server is another topic, while Cloudflare offer the [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) application, to create a tunnel between their servers and my private webserver. This can be a [awesome](./blog/awesome/README.md) way to at least, own the data and own the server for only, Electricity cost + Internet cost. Then I start to investigate, what I need to have a [secure](./blog/linux/permissions.md) host, beside the Firewall features that Cloudflare already offer for free, to registered users who own a domain, and naturally, to all developers.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) can be a good approach, while I always like the old fashion of a [Nginx](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker) server or [Apache](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker). A [Self Hosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) application is awesome, while having the server outside home and have the Admin-Panel running at home, by my will, is another good approach. Then the server have no Login-Form on Internet, and therefor, the attack surfice is lower.

 I find amazing projects at GitHub with all kind. [Fail2Ban](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Fail2Ban-Blacklist-JAIL-for-Repeat-Offenders-with-Perma-Extended-Banning) is a known software for servers, to block what they call "offenders", which is malicious activity from random users using automatic scripts, or people who know more about how to think, can find [bugs](./blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/ABBT.md) in the code, to be able to hack the code, while my side needs to think about the other side of the attack, which is focused on [Security](./blog/awesome/files/Security/Defensive/ASH.md) techniques to prevent all kind of [Security](./blog/awesome/files/Security/Defensive/ATDH.md) issues.

In this investigation I found that even **Google** do some [SPAM](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Stop.Google.Analytics.Ghost.Spam.HOWTO) and there is a [Phishing Database](https://github.com/Phishing-Database/Phishing.Database). O_o

I personally use in my Linux computers, the [StevenBlack](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts) hosts or for a **paranoid** situation the [Ultimate-Host-Blacklist](https://github.com/Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist/Ultimate.Hosts.Blacklist), which are projects that are regulary updated.

My web surf is cleaner and I feel better.
