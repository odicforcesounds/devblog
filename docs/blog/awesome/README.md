- Education express what may be moral and ethic to produce in reality, while education is as well a technique, which mean that is full of dualities. Teaching the "Evil" or teaching the "Angelic" is always teaching. ;)

## Security

- The Duality of Security. Everything is insecure while producing insecurities is the easiest technique to *rule* others.
Hopefuly you understand the problem and use your knowledge wisely.
- Join a **Red Team** and exploit the system to make it better, not to *rule* others who know nothing about your intentions. 
- Military can do bad things to civilians, but the point is to secure the community, not to exploit them. 

#### Defensive Security (the good)

- Turn off your computer and you will be save from this **Chaotic Mess full of Mad Logs**, a Festival of stricted permissions and applications isolations processed by computers.
