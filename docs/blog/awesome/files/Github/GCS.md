# Awesome Stuff

This file and repository aims to organize links or files from another **awesome lists**.

This README.md can have comments made by me, that can be offensive to you. <br>
Please understand that I am not a _god_, therefor, what ever I "say" or "write" will change some day. <br>
And remember: Words do nothing, only if we pay attention to them, while we can ignore them. <br>

<quote>
**Monkey Listen Nothing** + **Monkey See Nothing** + **Monkey Talk Nothing**  
</quote>

Comments are made by a principle of an idea of morality or ethics. <br>
Subject I like to think and talk. Pure psychology and sociology,<br>
while the exercise of thinking is called philosophy. ( The principle of everything ) <br>
Don't forget that I am a living organism and therefor, the "melody" of my own time perception, change. <br>
People commonly call this "skill" as "Flow". Go with the flow. Sometimes we can choose, some others, we are flowing. <br>
**Note**: If you wish to contribute, just add yours or some other that is not in the list, but leave the comments empty.
