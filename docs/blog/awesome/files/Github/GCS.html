<strong>awesome lists</strong>.</p>
<p>This README.html can have comments made by me, that can be offensive to
you. <br> Please understand that I am not a <em>god</em>, therefor, what
ever I “say” or “write” will change some day. <br> And remember: Words
do nothing, only if we pay attention to them, while we can ignore them.

Nothing</strong> + <strong>Monkey Talk Nothing</strong><br />

<p>Comments are made by a principle of an idea of morality or ethics.
<br> Subject I like to think and talk. Pure psychology and
sociology,<br> while the exercise of thinking is called philosophy. (
The principle of everything ) <br> Don’t forget that I am a living
organism and therefor, the “melody” of my own time perception, change.
<br> People commonly call this “skill” as “Flow”. Go with the flow.
Sometimes we can choose, some others, we are flowing. <br>
<strong>Note</strong>: If you wish to contribute, just add yours or some
other that is not in the list, but leave the comments empty.</p>
