# SSH

## Client-side

SSH is for secure communications.

If you are using Linux, ensure you create your personal key.

```sh
ssh-keygen
```

Be sure you add your keys to ssh-db.

```sh
eval $(ssh-agent)
key-add .ssh/newkey_rsa
ssh-copy-id user@server
```

Your new Private SSH-KEY was stored in $HOME/.ssh folder.

You can create more to different hosts. Be sure you put your new ssh-keys into ~/.ssh/

You can use **scp** to transfer files from server to client or client or server.

Configure .ssh/config file for each host you may need to connect

---

## Server-side

You can configure ssh to run as a server, into any machine you wish to connect using ssh.

Edit:

```sh
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

- Recommended:

  1. Forbid root logins
  2. copy your public key to ssh-server with 'ssh-copy-id'
  3. Forbid logins with password
  4. accept only known public keys connections

Restart SSH Server 

``` 
/etc/init.d/ssh restart 
```

Connect without using a passwd 

``` 
ssh user@server
```
