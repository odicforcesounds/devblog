      <p>Police can be super useful for any society, even if they are "open" to see others doing something wrong, without the desire to punish them but to guide them for better choices and to help them if they need, because if you find a better choice for all the problems that others have, most of them will change their personal choices. Anyway, one of these days I was reading about Portugal news and it looks like some Police group, was exploiting some Indian Famity that went to that country to have a better life, like all others that travel to other countries, try. If police was professionals (these specific group members), they would inform that family about the possibilities to have better conditions, but since they were <a href="./legalPoliceCorrption.html">corrupt</a>, they start to enslave them and asking what no one ask to someone for free. Naturally, because this family didn't learn Portuguese, which is a condition that I think that should be obligatory to all who move to some new country, they just accept that condition without any rejection. Naturally they were in a fragile condition and the ones that should help them, enslave them.</p>
      <p>There is another Police force in Portugal that with the name <b>PJ</b> which is the <b>Justice Police</b>, which is funny to think, since Portugal have several police forces and there is only one that use the name <b>Justice</b> as a identification of their activity on being police, which can lead us to the obvious conclusion that all other police groups do not suport <b>Justice</b>. Anyway, this police force is a bit more serious than the others, or at least they look like if you read something about them, but for this specific case, this police force was the police group that arrest the other members of the other police force, that were abusing from others Human Rights</p>
      <p>One of the funny thing in Portugal is that there are several Police Forces. There is a Police of the Police, which lead us to understand that these kind of events of Police abuse is something common, which for me is funny. </p>
      <p>So, if you need to talk to some police, ask them to call the police that police them in a recursive way and after that "command" you will have so many police forces that, whatever you need from them, it will give you a sensation that none of them knows exactly what each can do to help you. :))) </p>
      <p>The world is <a href="./youAreSoWeek.html">Awesome</a> and most of the times better than the best joke in the world. So let us <a href="./portugueseStupidLaws.html">laugth</a> about it and enjoy the <a href="./myCulture.html">Stupidity</a> of life.</p>
