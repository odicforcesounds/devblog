      <p>I don't know, why all other servers-owners in this world, don't send to the <a href="./TopAttackerIPs.html">Police</a> the report of attacks, so the police can investigate, arrest these people that pass their lifes attacking others sites, but maybe this is not the best approach, since the <a href="./stupidPolice.html">Police</a> sometimes ignore their professional dutty, which result in ignoring what they should pay attention to.</p>
      <p>We are always FREE to make a <a href="./style_of_god.html">choice</a>. My choice was to report the abuse, because my sites like I describe in <a href="./violentTeachers.html">this</a> article, don't use any fancy framework and therefor, all attempts that don't follwo the original links flow, are attacks. I normally ignore them, mainly when is only one or two, but when these atttacks are many per second, I will report them to the police of the attacker IP city.</p>
      <p>In some countries there are specific police departments to deal with these situations, but I have have time and by Free Will of Choice, I don't attack sites or persons or countries or continents or planets, or living beings. I agree that those who like to attack others, should be arrested until they learn to not attack, which for that, they only need to learn how to ignore what they don't like to see, to prevent to give power to what they don't like. It is a Lesson for Children, but sometimes adults didn't learn it. So I hope they enjoy Prison! :) </p>
