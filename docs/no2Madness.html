    <!-- TITLE -->
    <h1 class="title1">The Right to do Mistakes and write/speak wrong</h1>

    <div class="textbox">
      <!--       BODY -->
      <p>From our very yearly years, until the end of our days, we will always do some mistakes, or express wrong perspectives, interpretations, being logical or not, is part of the process of those who wish to learn more. I remember that <a href="./apache2.html">old post of this blog</a>, where I write about Apache2, having some CGI(Perl) modules that would be the problem of their security issues, while after some days, I <a href="./apacheIssues.html">wrote</a> this article that say that the problem in Apache2 was in fact in TomCat software.</p>
      <p>So, if you think a bit, you will find that I don't know much about software and security of it, but since is a subject that I like to read and be aware of it, I try to find an answer that can be wrong, as all of them are. In security we read that security problems can rise, when we use too much resources and services in on single machine that run them all, which open the surface of attacks. Naturally, that exploiting this vulnerabilities without using a script, is where knowledge and rational thinking, can demonstrate us, how this kind of issues are found, but I cannot deny that only those who can understand the code, are the ones who can exploit it, without using pre-configures scripts, like the mfsconsole software in Kali Linux.</p>
      <p>In the perspective of security, all blue teams need to learn from red teams, and red teams from blue teams, more than competing between each others, while the competition system can be positive to upgrade any project. I see it positive, since everything we can do, is made with our fingers and our brain, using a computer. That is the power within all of us, where the strongest is in fact the one who study more and think more about small details of any piece of software. </p>
      <p>Is like the military. They could focus in developing better and secured Social systems, while for the last centuries, soldiers don't see how Social skills could be used for the same military propose without using guns or without using violence. If Military and Police, test the Social-Security that can have many issues, in Social-Talks, that flow information, they could create a society more secure in that aspect of, knowing what each should or not speak, with who, etc... how to extract information without punish someone, etc... </p>
      <p>Hopefully, all military services in the world, one day, maybe in 100000000000000000000 centuries in the future(since they are slow to make this little change), we will have a secure society, able to trick the tricky ones, able to detect malicious activities and treat them with the same tools they need to develop anything. Education: Reading, Thinking, Practicing and repeating everything again, until the information is written in memory and by that condition, be the first choice of each living being. </p>
      <p>So don't be mad with me, mainly if you don't agree with something you read. We all have time to learn, while in the end, we will forget everything we learn.</p>
