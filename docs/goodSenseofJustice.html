      <p>As You may think, if you are able to think, Education is the main instrument that educate values and the only and unique way to create movement and change. Inside education there are some principles, that use other tools to create a possible dinamic where each tool do it's duty and don't fall in the desire to control everything. I mean, I am talking about Justice from history and actual days. You see, Justice is that technique that can have an expression of being hard or severe, while is just the expression of being conscience by listening what others need to tell us, about the conscience that we should correct. That is the funcional of justice. But Justice is a instrument of education, because without education, justice is a criminal tool, that aim to educate using Long Time of unjustices, because Justice have the desire to rule the world. In this perspective we can say that <a href="./theGoodOnChristianity.html">Christianity</a> cultures try to be more fair on judging people, which is another positive side that Christianity have better than many others, believing in goodness, which is good for most cases, even if, it is necessary to be balanced in how good everything should be, because in like everything is good and bad at the same time, like the work create the piece, all process can be painful, while if you are conscient about it, you can change it for the better. Some other iniciatives that promote cultural mixing and many other things, a purpose of being good, educated and fair is as well part of how Christianity develop to become better. Anyway, Justice is just a tool of education. Like playing is. Sports should not try to rule the world, while it does, because sports are just another tool of education, but sports follow education proposes, so I cannot block Sports from growing even if, "selling and buying human being" is a old practice, but this days we cannot deny that slavement on sports can be High investments of a single human life. Are they all Jesus Christ? Because the Goals and victuries are the result of training and persistence, not God Will of Choice, which can be a contradictory sense to be thankful to God, when it was the Team that create that possibility working Hard to make it possible. Music is another tool used on education. Music should not try to rule the world, but I cannot deny that it does, while the magic touch of the sound, can touch hearts without telling a single word, even if many musical pieces have words to yiel.. most in the name of Freedom to Dream and Be, what was in Time, forbidden to Be, the free movement of Dreams, for all next generations, Eternal Inspiration Tool to create connections between living beings, even with non-rational, since sound is a <a href="./offensiveMessage.html">powerful</a> tool to create change on all living beings, who should being enjoying peace. Being able to dream is another tool used on Education, to be possible to transcend what the mind is able to see, while Fantasy should not rule the world, even if it does, because reality is not fantasy, even if fantasy is pointing to reality. </p>
