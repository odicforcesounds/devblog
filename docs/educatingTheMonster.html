      <p>You can search on Internet, how is the process of educating a Dog that attacks everyone. There was a old movie called "The White Dog", which is similar to the real process of <b>Educating the Monster</b> that, that Dog had. You know that the Dog will attack you. So, you need to put some protections to be able to deal with his anger. But you know as well, that <b>Not even the Monster</b> have Eternal Anger and somewhere in Time, he will need to rest. Since your main objective is to create a "Good Relationship", you main want to pass all day with the dog until the moment you go to sleep. If you repeat this process all days, in less than a week, you have a "new friend", that can start to demonstrate that he wants to protect you. <br>
     <p> Then you need to solve another problem, but the first one is on it's way to be solved. You may need more people that join your dedicated classes for the Dog, with different persons, all of them protected against any "irregular behavior" of the Dog, and after one or two weeks more, starts to "feel better" in the company of those other living beings that (somewhere in Time(were agressive and violent against him)), which was the condition of his irregular behavior in the Past, which was the condition of Change for his present days, by the will of someone who dedicate Time on that objective. </p>
      <p class="center">This is what Religions Need to Learn and All other Groups in the World <br>
      Spiritual or not, religious or not, should do: <br>
      Understand the condition of Simplicity of what <a href="./style_of_god.html">God</a> gave to All.<br>
      Understand Our Eternal and <a href="./whatGodLikes.html">Divine</a> Characteristic: "will"... <br>
      To educate the Monster to become a peaceful living being, it is what <b>POWER</b> is!
