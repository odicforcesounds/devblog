      <p>Security Verification: "We have this code of conduct that ask us, to don't reveal the internal process of validating information". How much I can trust you? For example, USA use this technique to "inject malicious code" in any group. How much you can give us information about the internal process of your company or country, if I give you this amount of money? How many persons you are able to destroy for this amount of money? Can you kill, rape and take from them anything? You are able to sell your own family for that money? We only care about the information that you can extract from your lovely company so we can destroy it. </p>
      <p>This is like pentesting. You find a vulnerable target, load on them the payload and run the script that was defined to them. The script can be something like this: "On Positive results: Kill vulnerable application. So the "Appliction that was vulnerable will not get any money at all, but only death".  </p>
      <p>I don't know examples made against USA that use the same technique they are using against Argentina or Japan / China and others, but I believe that, if someone use that technique to exploit USA fragilities, USA would considere them criminals, but if is made by the USA government, is only "Justice". </p>
      <p>This is funny and the more I know about Pentesting, the more I see examples in reality that are very similar. </p>
      <p>We can use this "bad techiques" to ensure that our group members are trustful, but since is about money, then is always easy to exploit any target. </p>
