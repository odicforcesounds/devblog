      <p>Based on <a href="./byHackers.html">this</a> article, where I say that OpenBSD developers are Hackers, is something that probably is not totally true, since they are developers concerned about security, not hackers concerned on exploiting security. Maybe <a href="./whoTheyAre.html">OpenBSD</a> developers who read the article didn't like to read my opinion, while I am a NOOB, they could understand that noobs like me, are all over the planet, saying something "stupid", that at least for them, is not true.</p>
      <p>In my Noob experience, Hackers are Creative persons that can be creative in several subjects. From Technology to Mechanics, Electronic, Physics, Art and many other subjects that exist in this world made by humans. But in fact, OpenBSD developers try to define their coding style principles saying: "Fix the Bug before Hackers can find them". So, they don't like to see themselfs as "hackers", maybe because they associate the Term "Hacker" to <a href="./mar.html">Malicious</a> Activities, and therefor, using the term to talk about how <a href="./awesome_story.html">Awesome</a> OpenBSD is at OS and Network Stack levels, is something that this groups don't like to read from anyone (not only on my articles).</p>
      <p>On the <a href="./defcom2026.html">DEF CON</a> conference and courses, defensive knowledge is part of what hacking is, like the Offensive approach's are. The <a href="https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2033/" target="_blank">last</a> DEFCON files from 2025 are already online to download and explore, and many other <a href="https://infocon.org/">Resources</a> that anyone can explore, while the registration for the next year events are already open, for Singapore.</p>
      <p>Anyway, OpenBSD comunity could like to be targeted, from other groups that focus their intention to exploit others code, creating together a healthy cycle, where ones focus on the defensive code and the others, trying to exploit the code that apply of the recommendations to be secure, like OBSD does. Personally, I start using OpenBSD as my Main Router, putting OBSD in Bridge Mode and there I control all traffic that goes in or out. I really like this OS that apply all the security features by <a href="./theBSDguy.html">Default</a>, which is perfect for those who wish to use a Secure Operating System, without knowing too much about the technical details that are needed to create a secure system. If you wish to use OpenBSD as a desktop, you may wish to change the default configurations, but this will take you to define the OS in a totally different direction. How much you don't need all security features that are implemented by default, by removing or changing them. </p>
