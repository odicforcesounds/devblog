      <p>News from USA against Narco Traffic is like games. "Click" - "Boom". </p>
      <p>Is the perfect contraction of Justice systems, since the Criminal ones are less contractory in that aspect of accepting and believing that any "punishment" result, which include death, is fair.</p>
      <p>Where is that Woman that represents Freedom, and that is Free to be what She wish to be, without any Prison? </p>
      <p>Oh yes, is part of the past and the past is irrelevant for you, is that right? </p>
      <p>She, originally was as well symbol of Justice.</p>
      <p>Naturally, to those who are in USA, that invest money (that USA gov cannot control) to ask more drugs, can somewhere is Time, quit the idea.</p>
      <p>In this process there is something good, while the process is something bad. </p>
      <p>It looks a familiar behavior, since for almost everything is life, is more or less the same, while the pain of the bad and the kisses of the good, are only to the self, not to someone else. Just another contractory fact, that is more positive than the first described in this texts. </p>
