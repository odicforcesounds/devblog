into the World of JavaScript</a></h2>
<div class="textbox">
<p>After reading almost 100.000 books ( articles ) about ReactJS and
NodeJS, I finally found that I need to use both.</p>
<p>NodeJS is made to Backend communications, like files or
databases.</p>
<p>ReactJS is made to improve the Frontend, like the UI and
Page-Behavior.</p>
<p>While I am developing the STK ( Social Tool Kit ) from the main
website of odicforcesounds.com domain with ReactNative, I found that I
don’t need to learn more than this two “Frameworks”.</p>
<p>I mean, NodeJS is not a Framework, but JavaScript for Machines (
outside the Browser ), while ReactJS is a Framework based on
JavaScript.</p>
<p>I really like the MongoDB aka NoSQL data structure style. It looks
super simple, compared to MySQL or PostgreeSQL, while using external
services like Firebase or Supabase is an optional choice.</p>
<p>Yes, I think I will use my old-machine (laptop) to store the data of
both applications. The STK application and the Bookstore that I need to
build to start selling some books. [In reference of the last post]</p>
<p>Is some perspectives I hate ReactJS, since I <strong>LOVE</strong>
static websites with static <strong>HTML</strong> and
<strong>CSS</strong>, like all my sites are.</p>
<p>But I need to force me to improve my skills and embrace the
Future.</p>
<p>So, I think I will start to write a bit more in my <a
href="https://macacopreguicoso.blogspot.com">Developing Blog</a> to
guide me to understand small / big details of both.</p>
<p>Is not a contradictory afirmation. Small details can result in Big
results. Is like making a SpaceTrip to the Moon. If a Small details
fails, can result in a Big failure, like a big big Explosion.</p>
<p>While the Big is as well, the result of several pieces that are
small, while together make one single piece that is Big.</p>
<p>Is like me and you. Your body is the Big result of many small pieces
that together make the whole of what is on you.</p>
<p>If a small fragment of you fail, all other pieces from you will fail
too.</p>
<hr />
<p>As I like to say: “I am just a Monkey and all Monkeys are noisy, as
they warn about the danger, while being peaceful animals”.</p>
<p>Don’t try to hurt me. The Bigs are watching to prevent that event.
And if it happen, the Big will become so Crazhy that you will wish to
stop them, but the only condition to stop them is on me.</p>
<p>So, Lets me do what I need to, and enjoy Your life as you should.</p>
<p>Keep Rocking and Enjoy the Show!</p>
