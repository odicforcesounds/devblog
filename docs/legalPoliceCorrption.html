      <p>Sadly for the majority of innocent people around the globe, they can probably have some problems with the Police, without being criminal or corrupt. This is not 100% true, while if is true by 10% you can imagine how big corruption can be. If you go into Youtube and search for some High Level Criminal groups, from Japan to Hong Kong (mainly), you know that the police will notify them about any probability that criminalize them as groups. Specific in Japan with the Yakuza, this mechanism is true, while in Hong Kong, the last years did change a lot, which result in a stricted control of many groups and their freedom. If you go into other places in the world, like <a href="./policeFreedom.html">Marrocos</a> or Brazil, you can have several legal problems and sometimes Vital problems, if you went to the wrong place in the wrong moment, or you are target as a random guy that can give some extra money to save his own life.</p>
      <p>But let us think about how this is possible and why there is some logic behind this common choice from those who swere to defend Legal Laws. If you start to investigate any kind of subject that can be used to <a href="./mar.html">malicious</a> activities, you may see that, in some cases you can win a extra money, since sadly justice members can "do whatever they wish to do" and only those who work for Justice systems, know what they can do and if they are "superior", like Dogs do, they will be very thankful to serve the superior in a happy way by demonstrating Joy to serve the superiors. But if you think about how Dogs like to have fun, you may need to give them something they can destroy to have some fun and feel satisfied, with whatever they had done. Can be bones or some other toy that make some noise, so they can destroy demonstrating happiness on that action. Police can be the same, but gladly not all (which would be a big shame for Justice systems). Anyway, if you wish to arrest some drug dealers (in case you don't think about what they are doing(selling something that someone else ask them to sell, by this someone Free Will of Choice)), then you need to be inside the flow of those mechanisms that control the flow of traffic (commercialization of a product that someone pay for). If you are a police that wish to have a lot of <a href="./pentestingSociety.html">money</a> (since police normally earn few and they have less freedom than many others public services), then you will probably "fall into that dark desire", to earn more money and therefor, you will help the ones that are transporting that product that others wish to buy and by that condition you become corrupt to the <a href="./refusing2Learn.html">Eyes</a> of Justice systems and all others that don't question <a href="./stupidMastodonLaws.html">Freedom</a>. </p>
      <p>Laws are Pointers like programming documentation is. In case you use the brain, You know that the Law try to specify rules that are objective for some specific cases. Naturally that Laws cannot do anything, but each one conscience, since for more than 20 centuries (to kill is forbidden) and murdering in society happen several times. In some other countries that are not the <a href="./behindTheScenes.html">USA</a>, guns are forbidden but justice members can use them and make collections of them. Raping <a href="./inTheNameOfJustice.html">Woman</a> Man or <a href="./blockingMyEvilCreativity.html">Children</a> is the same, but those events continue to happen. Some of this events have <a href="./hackingJustice.html">simple</a> solutions, some others are not so simple to <a href="./learningbyteaching.html">fix</a>, but all depend on each one conscience and condition, while the Justice systems only care about how much courage a justice member need to have, while that is irrelevant to create a good justice system.</p>
      <p>For example, I create <a href="./TopAttackerIPs.html">this</a> page to record some data from the attackers that are against this sites, using software made to exploit <a href="./wordpress_attacks.html">PHP</a> frameworks, like Laravel, Wordpress and others and I add a collumn with the name <b>Status</b> that refer Police sites of attackers cities as being reported to them. Naturally even if this looks the BEST option, is not, since normally police is corrupt and what would happen for Hong Kong and Japan police, is that they would notify the groups about me. :)<br> <br> 
      More corruption as you may see. So, I remove that collumn and I just expose their IPs, Country and City if they are real (lol),  since they could proxy it. Just one guy from Canada that I remove his information from that list, start visiting this site using Tor. I imagine that is the same guy because the User-Agent is the same. Nothing against the Tor network. If privacy is a concern, I can accept it, while if that privacy is to abuse, I am against it, like some other American guy start using a VPN to attack my sites. This is another problem of "privacy", but I am fine with that, I can block their domain too, if some day they use their <a href="./usingTheBrain.html">Brain</a>, since the majority continue to <a href="./youAreSoWeek.html">attack</a> this sites, without changing the techniques, because they refuse to read the code of this site, using the Right Bottom of the Mouse to see the code and therefor, they believe that all sites in the world are based on Wordpress. :) </p>
      <p>Well, I really hope that Justice systems can become better in the next 10000000000000000 centuries, since the Justice systems were Violent, Agressive, Criminal and Deadly in the last 40 Centuries (at least). </p>
