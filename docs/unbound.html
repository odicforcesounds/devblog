      <p>One of the chats I had in the IRC server on Libera was about the <b>unbound</b> service. With this, you can filter all kind of HTTP request and tranform headers and more. Is not limit to HTTP request, but to all kind of protocols. The documentation from <a href="./openbsdDevelopers.html">OpenBSD</a> is really good, but in fact is not enought to give you this notion of how much this service can be useful. Today I found the Official documentation for this service and I had an "erection". LoL Oh My God... this is what I love to read.</p>
      <p class="center"><b>https://unbound.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html</b></p>
      <p>If you are a person who like to read the documentation to setup your services the way you need, not by copying what others share on internet to guide your choices, and you know about the <b>Unbound</b> service, you going to love this Literature Book, that is not so big, but it guide you in more details about the power of this application. At least on OpenBSD, you don't need to installed, since it is already installed by default. You just need to activate the service and setup the necessary configurations to create the behavior you wish to see in your server. I use it for HTTP request, to ibject the default headers that I think I need for my users, but you can use it for all kind of things. </p>
