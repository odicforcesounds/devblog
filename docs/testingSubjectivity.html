      <p>The most shared publication of the day. The most viewed publication in the day, while the <a href="./drewDevaulsBlog.html">article</a> before that last one, is about something interesting to read, but since does not explicitly say that is forbidden to share, was shared less times than the last one that explicit say (you cannot). </p>
      <p class="center">Drew DeVault - As You can see, after more than 20 centuries, the behavior is the same</p>
      <p>So, we may question the same: "Did people learn the Lesson or they are just Repeating the Mistake?</p>
      <p>Yeah, people do it because is Fun, since is forbidden. <br> 
      So, if you want to see people copying the CopyLeft license, you need to explicit describe something like: <br> 
      "IF YOU ARE HUMAN YOU CANNOT READ, COPY, SHARE OR MODIFY THIS LICENSE",<br> and they will, faster than you ever Imagine</p>
      <p>This is a concept proof, for big Companies ;) --> If you wish to block copies, just move to some license that do NOT forbid copies ;) </p>
