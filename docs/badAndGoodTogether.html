      <p>Like Lovers, playing together. Like friends, playing together. In IT, the "Bad" that can exploit and break others computers or networks, are getting this "little space" where their knowledge can be used for good, if the "Good" understand and accept that approch. Pentesting is on the Rise and with that, companies can develop better solutions. Not really better, but more secure, while being secure is better. There is always someone who can break the rules, while if someone did, is because the system have some fragility. Naturally, there is this idea that, systems don't need to be secure, since they are working as expected, but to make a perfect "Love Story", while the good focus in flexibility and performance, the bad focus in security and control. In reality, the same happen. Now, after so many centuries without using the "Bad" to make the "Good" better, hopefully in the next 10000000000000000000000000000000000 Centuries, humanity will learn how to deal with the "bad" in a positive way and the "bad" can do the same with the "good". This "almost eternal" <b>Love Story</b>, between the "Bad" and the "Good", goes always to the same direction, but at least in IT, this is getting better. Even if there are a lot of security issues in the web, the "Good" are paying attention to this, because they wish to have secure systems to offer better services. As explained in another post, the "Good" don't always care about details from what the "Good" described as they believe, while privacy is always a concern, since the "Good" don't hide and the "Bad" don't like to be shown in the condition of being exposed as "Bad". I think this is natural, because the "Good" will not like the same. If the "Good" is exposed as the "Bad", the "Good", will not like it. So, there is no difference between them in that moment. Is  in this point that they have something in common, but we cannot deny that the "Good", try to hide the bad things the "Good" do, while the "Bad", do the same, as the "Bad" try to hide all the bad things the "Bad" do. Just another common point between them, and with that, just another common relation that connects them into one. That is what love is, right? No. Love is not only the Romantic experience. Love is not only the Sex experience. Love is dedication, self sacrifice and persistence. I think both, the "Good" and the "Bad", can Love, since there is another common point between them. </p>
