    <title>Nato: A Dual Perspective of the same organization</title>

      <p>This is how Nato works. Your country is having some problem with another country? We can help your country, or by accepting to give something and Nato will send some soldiers to deal with the problem, or if you don't wish to share something, we can give you guns so you can continue the war, that you wish to fight alone with.</p>
      <p>There is always a dual condition, which you cannot exclude Nato from your options. Mainly because You will probably don't have the same "power support", from any other country in the world and in that perspective Nato become something that looks good, while the support they can give, is almost of the times, a bad support, since it will empower you to continue something that, will never solve any problem in the world, which are wars. </p>
      <p>A curious aspect of these society development is that, for example the Muslin that should only apply Islamic Laws in Islamic Territories, they demonstrate the desire to implement them anywhere they are, in the name of that "respect" that expect "Freedom of choice". In my opinion that is wrong, since the Freedom to apply those Laws already exist in their territories, in the other side of the coin, we see that all other countries in the world that fight to those rights, would like to do the same in all other countries, like <a href="./drugsSalvation.html">History</a> demonstrate with other examples that are about the same subject "Religious Freedom", which should be accepted if there is a respect of all other choices that are the same. Is like accepting Muslin Laws in the USA, while the Muslin, don't accept other practices that exist in USA. And there is where the one who "ask rights" should understand first what are their "duties" inside another country that is not their origins. </p>
      <p>Is about Cultural Respect, is not about Freedom of Choice, since that, everyone have, ones more than others, I must admit that is that aspect, <a href="./theGoodOnChristianity.html">Christian</a> cultures in actual days, are more open to that "Freedom of Expression", being from Woman or Man, which is a Good aspect as a result of their transformation in Time. Christianity was and is the Religious Groups that try to become better than what they were somewhere in Time. In the above link I make a historical Review of Christianity choices, while here I wish to refer to what Christian societies become, after so many centuries in the same condition of all others, which is "being stoped in Time". While some of them, can be stoped in Time, because their main objective is not to Punish others for their Freedom of Choice, but to Guide them in their Freedom of Choice.</p>
      <p class="center">So, in that state of <a href="./freedom.html">Freedom</a>, we can say that Nato can be good and bad at the same Time. </p>
