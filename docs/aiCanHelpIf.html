      <!--       BODY -->
      <p>I was exploring the Defcon links, and I found the YouTube channel <b>Channel2600</b> with this interesting subjects in a conference called <b>HOPE</b>. I start exploring and I found this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdYT1vUrj34">geek</a> speaking about Solar Energy and Solar Punk stuff, that is most likely <b>Defcon</b> is. One Solar System many Moons, is what Our "small Universe" is made of.</p>
      <p>The CyberPunk, is a love story about the SolarPunk and MoonPunk. Putting away the details that all like to know, (porn) is a good vision, while I believe in the principles of collaboration, my application aims to produce that connectivity in being helpful, within persons. Maybe my application follows the Punk side of Life, which can be more efficient without wasting too much energy.</p>
      <p>She ends her talk saying: <b>You are the Future...</b></p>
      <p>Aren't we?</p>
      <p>I imagine a world where AI can help all. Imagine a world where a website is attacked, and inform all other sites about the issue. If all server where hosted by a AI brain, that speaks with all others, and recommends and teach, dumbs, newbies, professionals and experts, the best practices, the Internet could be more safe. Can you imagine? A virus that infect a computer and in the next second, all other machines in the world already know what features or software they need to lock to prevent and block the same attack on them. Imagine a system fighting against the virus, without a external software like an anti-virus. Traffic analisys to detect hacking. I think that, we the knowledge we have, AI can be used to help us in many different subjects, while "my application" use the only Intelligent software made by Time. Persons. No AI integration. You are the Future ( The Intelligent being ), not AI. </p>
      <p>All humans fail. Why not having AI to prevent we fail less?</p>
      <p>Is not about becoming "stupid" and more dumb, since AI can explain the suggestions.</p>
      <p>We can "follow orders", by understanding them, and with the opportunity(option B,C,D,E,F,G) to make different choices.</p>
      <p>We can "follow suggestions" of our best friend, if this Friend, always care to guide us to make better choices, since we can explain our situation, so AI can make better suggestions. AI could be more humanized, to guide us in all those moments we feel alone. AI could be a substitute of all persons, and I could live closed in a room, or explore the world, with the guide of our eternal friend that Knows about many things, and how to deal with them. </p>
