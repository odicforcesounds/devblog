      <p>As I like to explore the world of possibilities, sometimes I believe in some of them, and start working to try to archive them. Life is full of failures and I know how much I fail  to do something that I didn't master, as it should. Sometimes I believe I am able, but reality demonstrate that I am not. Some other times I think that something inside me, is denying to make it right, without my own conscience and what goes wrong is part of what I cannot see on me, that is doing something in a incorrect way. Sometimes I think that the only thing I know is to write, texts about something or nothing at all.</p>
      <p>Children can do wrong choices, since at that age, everything can be just another adventure that will teach us something. I don't know, how many wrong choices I made to be sure about what I like or dislike, what I accept or reject. I don't know, but I know, that was all those failures that put me where I am. I look to the past and I don't always feel happy about it. Sometimes I cannot deny, I was good and the "universe" was dancing with my goodness. Sometimes I just copy someone else choice, just because the ones who I trust, made the same choice. Children can do wrong choices, as adults can, since each one, have some "child inside", that will be recognized from outside to inside. Sometimes I think I know how to think, while others I think I don't know how to think.</p>
      <p>What I expect after all this time, is to repeat everything again, while something can change, maybe the one who needs to change is me. In fact I can be what I am, the change that is needed is part of choices, not part of how I feel or think. I am what Time created. Did I have a choice? Yes I did, but the choices were not always the best. Is those kind of choices that you wish to have some feedback, so you can analise the content of the product, the content of the funcional and cycling steps that everything can have. How much you like to deal with "this" aspects that repeat over and over again?</p>
      <p>In each failure, a vibrant sansations own the mind and the body, and the only thing we can do is to embrace it or to deny it. Those who embrace it will become violent and those who deny it will suffer in a peaceful style, without reacting to that musical rithmic that is playing strong inside.</p>
