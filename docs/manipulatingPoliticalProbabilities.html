      <p>Be being conscience of the reality each have around, the common expression is to use the expression that the majority likes to see to recognize someone as being from the same group. You know, this article try to put in cause if Elon Musk use the "Rigth-Wing" Expression, and by the condition of information relationship, being interpreted as being <a href="./stupidMastodonLaws.html">Nazi</a>, but just being in fact a way to ironicly saying, "yeah what ever you wish to see from me", which would result in the interpretation that he is just <a href="./PoliticalLoveLesson.html">Representing</a> the group that he was representing in those public talks, since they give him the permission to speak in their name, while we know that Elon Musk is not a political guy, but someone that have a lot of money, which is the function that create movement in society, but producing possible solution that can somehow be useful to someone else, like all Investments in the World are.</p>
      <p class="center">We can say that "the Flow of information that is in memory" <br>
      take the effect of the last relationship that is in memory. <br>
      It doesn't mean he is what is did represent, since all representations in the world, <br>
      are not what they express, but "deeper", or "superficial", as they intent to point to some direction <br>
      that point to some preference, based on those main 4 "Pillars" that need to exist in society, <br>
      that are splited in two different main groups, that didn't learn to love each others without fighting.
