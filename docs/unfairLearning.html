      As You may think, just by listening stories from history or by reading them, many persons learn by a condition that would punish them, if they do some mistake. I don't know who the Heck like to learn by that condition, but those who use it, should learn not to used, without being punished for doing mistakes, else the punishment should be 10 times more hard, since they agree with that approach. I don't know, who the Heck believe that this mechanism of learning anything is healthy, but only a sadic would believe that everyone and including him self, would considere that punishing others is a normal and conscient method of teaching. That is the criminal behavior that many places in the world, keep giving continuity. I don't wish bad to anyone, just because they made mistakes, and those who wish to punish others, are insane and should be arrested for it. Is part of education of many institutions, govermental or private. The crime that the "good" do, and with it, create the "bad", that suffer from punishment, just for doing mistakes. Education discipline and method, is just a "bridge" that is "present" to guide, choices, giving full permissions to other make mistakes, because is based on them, that everyone learn, while is in that precise moment, that Education can Bright and be what Educations, aims to be. Guide choices sharing knowledge. 
      </p>  
      <p>Goverment institutions should learn about self control, on denying that punitive behavior and choice, as a mechanism to educate and create better, examples for society.</p>
      <p>Even to educate dogs, cats, tigers, lions, elephants, rats, birds, etc... the last choice, is to use violence, while that violence can be simulated by Noise and Expression, without physical intervension. </p>
      <p>History demonstrate it self, that the unfair choice is the preference of many. That is why we keep growing in that direction. </p>
