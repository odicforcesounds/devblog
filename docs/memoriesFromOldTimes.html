      <p>Maybe my brain create them without my will to create them. Maybe they are part of some dream, that I had, and the brain record them as something important to save. 
      But, what is true is that I have these memories that I cannot define their origin and the reasons of them.</p>
      <p>Don't ask me to remember what you wish to remember, because my memories are different from yours (Dear Dragon) <br>
      As You may remember, <a href="./style_of_god.html">God</a> gave you the Eternal Duty to Protect the Monkey and create Monkey illusions, <br>
      like any Father will do, when his Son is dreaming about something he wish to see in reality...</p>
      <p>Monkey memories are part of that Good sensation that doesn't pay too much attention to what is going on.</p>
      <p>Monkey walk in the street and see a lonely Dog</p>
      <p>So the Monkey say loudly: "How would be, if this Dog have a house?"</p>
      <p>And in the next moment of Time, the House was created for this little Dog.</p>
      <p>The Monkey walk a bit more and see a Cat</p>
      <p>So the Monkey say loudly: "How would be, if this Cat have a house?</p>
      <p>And in the next Moment of Time, the House was created for this little Cat</p>
      <p>And the Monkey ask to the Dragon: How this is possible? I Dream about this cute animals to have a House and the House was created for them.</p>
      <p>And the Dragon answer was: It is Magic dear Monkey, pure Magic.</p>
      <p>Naturally that the Dragon did create them, but without Monkey perception.</p>
      <p><i>If ones can only dream, others can only produce the Dream, which is fair, since workers don't always have time to dream.</i></p>
      <p>The Monkey is the Eternal Child. The one who can do silly things, joke with reality, being <a href="./offended_chinese.html">provocative</a> like any child can be, being <a href="./offensiveMessage.html">offensive</a>, like any child can be. And the Dragon, the Eternal Wise, who don't make funny jokes, while understand the humor within Monkey Jokes, the one who is not Offensive or Provocative, while understanding the misery of Monkey Dreams. For all Eternity this condition is True to both, as the Tiger can be the Mother of this Relationship that is all about <a href="./monkey_love.html">Love</a>. </p>
