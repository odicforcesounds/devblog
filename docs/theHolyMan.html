      <p>The Men who share the <b>man</b> is the men who cares to guide other man. </p>
      <p>Manual pages are the <b>man</b> and those who write them, the <b>men</b>.</p>
      <p>I don't know, but like everything else that share the knowledge that is needed to anyone use it, that content become <b>holy</b>, by that condition that share knowledge. Years ago I remember to read some man pages. It was a bit crazy, because there are some <i>man pages</i> that are really big, and you just want the example that explain the syntax without exploring the theory of it, deeper. But we cannot deny how useful is, to understand in a deeper level, what ever we can see or use. Sometimes <i>man pages</i> lead us to be more confused, while some others, the solution we need. OpenBSD is all about <i>man pages</i>, that describe how each default application works, what options are enable or disable, what kind of uses we can do, and the relation between many other programs and configuration files of the system. I starting to like OpenBSD, while I like to find some example on the Internet, that explain a bit more about <b>howto</b> do something, without taking the <b>man pages</b> as the unique source to learn how to use each of this applications. In fact, many of them are useful only to developers, mainly the ones that are developing OpenBSD, while many other applications are more for all other mortals that are not developers. </p>
      <p>I really prefer woman, not man, but .. oh man, what can we do about this creative moment of Unix creators? Here is my version: "Wow this manuals are awesome.. I will call them Woman." :)</p>
      <p>Sometimes we always need to make use of <i>search engines dorks</i> to be able to find some really good articles that are not exposed in the first pages when we are trying to find a solution for our problems. There are a lot of <b>blogs</b> from some <b>men</b> that are technical, that can teach us a little bit more, without understanding the <b>man</b> pages. Understanding the <b>man pages</b> is the best choice, but some of them are really complex. I remember for example, the <i>man ffmpeg</i>. I lost some hours reading and after that I forgot what I wish to do with it. :) </p>
