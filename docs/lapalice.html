      <p>Facebook is a platform that can create to people like me, the desire to answer any subject that is shared publicly or between friends. This is how I learn about one of the interpretations of how "truth" can be so volatil in it's  interpretation. For me, a person that likes to see himself as <a href="./beingFair.html">being</a> a <a href="./racismo.html">Monkey</a>, the term "la Palice", was used to answer my answer to another answer that declare the main post as "the drawback", of "truth". The post is about the <a href="./evilFiles.html">Epstein Files</a> as something that can hide some dark and Evil content by the form of something "beauty".</p>
      <p>As the <a href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com" target="_blank">Monkey who doesn't Listen</a>, I try to understand what I am, by being the expression of what I believe, since is by that condition that I can express something wrong and with it, Learn to become better, since is what I can do in this life, no matter what is in each mind.</p>
      <p>I don't mind to be compared to a Police, in this aspect of how I try to warn about the danger in Life. But if I see myself as a Police, like Monkeys can be in the Jungle, I must say that I am a different Police. For example, I am not against "Drugs" or against those who commercialize them, but I am against "Guns", since I know by history, that Guns are the objects that Kill many inocent people, while those who die from consuming drugs did kill themselfs only. For me "suicide" is more Moral than "Homicide". If Guns were used to kill the one who use them, by their will to Die, I wouldn't be against Guns, Bombs and any Military objects. I am against that choice that create wars between people, in any kind of society, that is the desire to control, dominate and possess, the material objects of Life, since we cannot fully control the subject content of life, we can accept to give the content of any subject to anyone in Life. </p>
      <p>But I don't mind to be "the Police", when injustices exist in reality. In fact, sharing and talking about this "Epstein File", is a way to be a Police by Reporting what is unfair and with that, we need to assume that being a Police against these files is Good. So, in that perspective the author of this publciation is as well "Police" and all others that agree that these persons associated to this crime activities must be judged, are Police too. Being a Police is something useful to fight against what can be unfair, while (The Police) that serve Governments, are not police, but slaves of <a href="./questionOrders.html">Orders</a>.</p>
      <p>My style to report the danger is naturally creative. I don't report people based on what the Law describe to be a crime, but based on the Values I believe. In fact, I don't report people, I try to report what is wrong in social networks. My reports, point to what I believe that is right and what is wrong, but those are just theories, not persons.</p>
