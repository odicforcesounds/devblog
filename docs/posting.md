# Posting 

## A Python Framework for Testing APIs

Be sure you install `python3-pip` and `python3-venv`. 

Create a folder to install Python applications

```bash 
mkdir pyvenv
```

Prepare enviroment to install Python packages 

```bash 
python3 -m venv pyvenv
```

Activate enviroment

```bash 
source ~/pyenv/bin/activate
```

Install package: In this case "Posting" 

```bash 
pip3 install posting
```

Open this framework that is super intuitive and test any HTTP request against any API. 

Enjoy! 

I really like this project!
