      <p>Imagine that you wish to learn how to play piano. For 99% of schools around the world, you will need to learn everything in a very structured way, step by step until somewhere in Time, be able to play something made by others, who probably pass the same process of you or not, depending how much genuine was their love about their favorite instrument. </p>
      <p>In monkey style, the child needs to play with the piano without any order or objective. The main objective is that the child or adult that wish to learn piano, improvise and try to find by their own, what melody they like, exploring the Sounds and recognizing them, without knowing anything about them. Only after that process of Freedom on exploring the piano, he can start learning and with that, they will become more creative by finding the names of almost everything they already know, just by exploring the piano without any rules. </p>
      <p>Some notes will sound strange, while the child or adult, identify that, the melody they are producing can be good or bad, depending on what they are trying to find without any limitations. When these students start to study, I am going only to give them some tips with total freedom to do "something wrong" ( if in Music "wrong" is possible ), since is not, because is part of the notes sequences that the composer need to listen to be able to create a sequence of notes that the composer feel that express what is inside of them, by giving them the possiblity to be Creative. </p>
      <p>After some months or years of testing, if they need the technical theory to improve everything they already know, is when the Monkey would recommend them to be more disciplined in that learning. I believe that anyone can learn anything by their Will to Learn something. I cannot and should not impose them to learn what they have no desire to learn, mainly when the content they are learning, is not useful for their reality as persons of society. Even to learn concepts about Civism, I believe that only giving them total freedom to do what is wrong, is the best way to teach, in case I am willing to share with them and discuss with, about the values behind the <a href="./EthicalLawsOnIT.html">Ethics and Morals</a> that are the base concepts to guide their choice. But I see wrong that I <a href="./monkeyDuty.html">Punish</a> children or adults for doing something wrong, without trying to instruction them in the moment they fail or did something wrong, which is the perfect moment to talk about what is right or wrong, explaining why. </p>
      <p>If You think about yourself, you born in some place that you don't know anything about it, and only after some years that you can recognize what  you have around, you start learning the names of anything, because you are always able to identify it. Then to learn to read or write becomes more easy.</p>
