      <p>I guess the last <a href="./byHackers.html">article</a> I say that OpenBSD have no "handbook", while we could say that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/">this</a> pages can be used as a handbook.</p>
      <p>Did you check the release notes about the changes? This guys don't care about compatibility if Security problems are associated. So if tell me that OpenBSD have some limitations, I need to agree with you, while everything has it's own limitations, If you have hardware issues, that is your problem, not them. Is interesting how features are added and removed, the list of internal features for developers that build their OpenBSD from Source Code, compiling all. </p>
