# Monkey Love

I found some Chinese restaurant in the city I live, that have a slogan that say "Eat what You love". Then I ask them if they have Dragons, because I love Dragons. Anyway, this article is not about Dragons, but about monkeys. I found this cute Monkey that write a lot about stuff I like to explore: https://s0cm0nkey.gitbook.io/ 

Is so cute that I almost had an erection! :D
