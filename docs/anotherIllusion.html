      <!--       BODY -->
      <p>While originally SunWukong is from China, the development of continuity of this Monkey story, was developed in Japan. I think that Japanese in this aspect are more creative than Chinese, but that can be a wrong expectation, since what happen in China is that, most people are almost addicted to their own culture and they like to remember it over and over again, without feeling the need to change it. In the other hand, Japan always change something from what is the original source and with that, awesome new anime stories, that can have some realistic aspect within. My sites are about that Monkey, while I never read the book. So, everything I do is based on what I can imagine, not based on what I had read about it. Because we all dream, about what we think is possible, I start developing this sites a few years ago. Right now I think I already spend more than 10 years, and I always thought that Japanese and Chinese would like my creativity, while being similar to everything that SunWukong resumes explain. A offensive Monkey (while being offensive is something children like to be), since adults who didn't develop self discipline, become "expontaneous murders", taking too serious what is expressed in reality. The monkey don't see it like that, since words don't change reality, they can only potencial our power to imagine and dream, and if you believe in something different from me, nothing will ever change just because you believe is something different. Another possibility is that God, did like me and in that aspect I feel that, at least "someone" did like me. With that in mind, I don't care if Chinese or Japanese don't like my sites, as I can see in logs of activity this last days, some japanese attacking my sites. Suck your own fingers and be happy! ;) </p>
