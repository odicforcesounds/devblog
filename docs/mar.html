<li>I can read all your requests after they reach the hosting site,
which is this one. :)</li>
<li>The service I use, <a
href="./blog/awesome/files/Security/Defensive/ATDH">log</a> your
activity, just to know how many visits I get, while this is useful to
know who is trying to <a
href="./blog/awesome/files/Security/Defensive/ASH.html">attack</a> my
sites.</li>
<li>I notice about <strong>World Wide</strong> malicious activity, that
is trying to <a
href="./blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/AR.html">hack</a> my
sites.</li>
<li>Sadly this gave me the sensation that I was getting popular, but I
was <a href="./false_hood.html">wrong</a>.</li>
<li>In fact, some Ireland guy, is all single days demonstrating to me,
that he is <del>my best fan</del>. The guy use the same script several
times per day. The most curious behavior from this guy is how much he
doesn’t understand what he is doing.
<ul>
<li>If You are in this page, is because you click or is because you have
been redirected. Yes, those who try to hack this site, are redirected to
this page.</li>
<li>Now this guy is attacking this page (using the <a
href="./wordpress_attacks.html">Wordpress Scanner</a>)</li>
<li>GET http://blog.odicforcesounds.com/mar.html/wp-admin/*</li>
<li>LoL</li>
<li>But I cannot deny that he was creative.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>From <strong>UK</strong>, <strong>North America</strong> to others,
the <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/tracks/12_Hacking_Festival/index.html">Hacking</a>
techniques are different, while all my sites, are
<strong>static</strong> and have no input-box to inject code, databases
or users.</li>
<li>Pure HTML &amp; CSS Only. There are some iframes from <a
href="https://bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> to listen the music I made. I
know the music is not awesome, but what can I say?
<ul>
<li>I can add the <a href="./blog/notes.html">security</a> headers to
accept iframes from this specific domain only too.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I am sure that is possible to <a
href="./blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/AHSE.html">hack</a> it, but
hopefully no one will.</li>
<li>Maybe you already know that I use <a
href="https://cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a> to manage <a
href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035">DNS</a> and other <a
href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616">HTTP</a> requests, so I
redirect them to <a
href="https://blog.odicforcesounds.com/blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/ABBT.html">this</a>
page, to motivate them to learn more.</li>
<li>What ever <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc791">IP</a> you
use, what ever continent you are, the rules are applied for all. (Fair)
<ul>
<li>You know, this <a
href="./blog/awesome/files/Github/GCS.html">attackers</a> use some Tool to
hack <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> frameworks, without
reading the <a href="./blog/awesome/files/Develop/APIs/AAD.html">code</a>,
that is accessible from the web browser. :D<br />
</li>
<li>I don’t know why, but I don’t like <a
href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a>. No Logic reason is true.</li>
<li>I Like <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a> and <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a>.</li>
<li><a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
can be useful and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">NodeJS</a> can be
useful too.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Well, in fact this specific sub-domain is made with <a
href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> only and hosted in
<strong>GitHub</strong>, like all other sub-domains.</li>
<li>I have no secrets for you. <strong>Tip</strong>: See for Yourself
the <strong>Source Code</strong> of all sites <a
href="https://github.com/odicforcesounds">here</a></li>
<li>To change sites content, you need to commit the changes in each site
repository, while if you read the <strong>README</strong> of
<strong>Art</strong> sub-domain repository, you see that your
contributions are welcome. In case you wish to share a comment, please
give it <a
href="https://github.com/orgs/odicforcesounds/discussions/5">here</a>.
<ul>
<li>While if you have <a
href="./blog/awesome/files/Virtualization/DCS.html">machine</a> power, you
can DDoS <a href="https://Microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> that owns <a
href="https://GitHub.com">GitHub</a> and CloudFlare that store this
website in cache, while I manage your requests.<br />
</li>
<li>After this 3 domains offline, my websites will be offline too, but
the site will be at <a href="https://archive.org">Archive</a> too.
:)</li>
<li>I already replicate the code in different code-hostings.</li>
<li>I see a lot of work for you, to <a
href="./blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/APCS.html">hack</a> me.</li>
<li>I am not so big that diserve your time for nothing.</li>
<li>But you are the one who knows what to do with your own time. Good
Luck!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I could try to <a
href="./blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/RSC.html">hack</a> you too,
since I have your <strong>IP</strong> and you are using <a
href="https://www.exploit-db.com/?type=remote&amp;platform=windows_x86-64">Windows</a>,
but I don’t spend my time <a
href="https://blog.odicforcesounds.com/style_of_god.html">fighting
against someone</a>, but by building <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Dao/login/index.html">something
new</a> for everyone.</li>
<li>In the end, you can even clone all my repositories, and open a pull
request with some new code.</li>
<li>Be Creative.</li>
