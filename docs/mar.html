sites.</li>
<li>Sadly this gave me the sensation that I was getting popular, but I

<li>In fact, some Ireland guy, is all single days demonstrating to me,
that he is <del>my best fan</del>. The guy use the same script several
times per day. The most curious behavior from this guy is how much he

<ul>

page, to motivate them to learn more.</li>
<li>What ever <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc791">IP</a> you
use, what ever continent you are, the rules are applied for all. (Fair)
<ul>

hack <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> frameworks, without
reading the <a href="./blog/awesome/files/Develop/APIs/AAD.md">code</a>,
that is accessible from the web browser. :D<br />
</li>
<li>I don’t know why, but I don’t like <a
href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a>. No Logic reason is true.</li>
<li>I Like <a

href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a>.</li>
<li><a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
can be useful and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">NodeJS</a> can be
useful too.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Well, in fact this specific sub-domain is made with <a
href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> only and hosted in
<strong>GitHub</strong>, like all other sub-domains.</li>
<li>I have no secrets for you. <strong>Tip</strong>: See for Yourself
the <strong>Source Code</strong> of all sites <a
href="https://github.com/odicforcesounds">here</a></li>
<li>To change sites content, you need to commit the changes in each site
repository, while if you read the <strong>README</strong> of
<strong>Art</strong> sub-domain repository, you see that your
contributions are welcome. In case you wish to share a comment, please
give it <a

<ul>
<li>While if you have <a
href="./blog/awesome/files/Virtualization/DCS.md">machine</a> power, you
can DDoS <a href="https://Microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> that owns <a
href="https://GitHub.com">GitHub</a> and CloudFlare that store this
website in cache, while I manage your requests.<br />
</li>
<li>After this 3 domains offline, my websites will be offline too, but

Luck!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I could try to <a
href="./blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/RSC.md">hack</a> you too,
since I have your <strong>IP</strong> and you are using <a
href="https://www.exploit-db.com/?type=remote&amp;platform=windows_x86-64">Windows</a>,
but I don’t spend my time <a
href="https://blog.odicforcesounds.com/style_of_god.html">fighting
against someone</a>, but by building <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Dao/login/index.html">something
new</a> for everyone.</li>
<li>In the end, you can even clone all my repositories, and open a pull
request with some new code.</li>
<li>Be Creative.</li>
</ul>
