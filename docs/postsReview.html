      <p>I always like to share some things that I use. This blog, somewhere is Time, was just a Markdown site, to share some things about Technology that are common for many. There is nothing special on this files, but can be, since depends on you, not on me.</p>
      <p> <a href="https://www.calcurse.org/">Calcurse</a> is a simples agenda + todo oraganizer. <a href="https://github.com/ihabunek/toot">Toot</a> is a Mastodon client. <a href="https://irssi.org/">IRSSI</a> that is a IRC client, very useful tool and, let us be thankful to all communities that maintain them. <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">Tmux</a> that is used to manage all these applications running in one single terminal window. <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> that is an text editor with simplicity in mind, <a href="https://github.com/acg/w3m">W3M</a> to browser the static web, full of text to read and without any kind of animations or publicity (no ads), <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> in case you use some public code hosting to maintain your blogs or services, like this blog is, <a href="https://mpv.io/">MPV</a> to listen some music or enjoy some movie to inspire your activity, and a list of <a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted">Awesome Self Services</a> that anyone can run on their computers. In actual days, you cannot use Gmail in a secure way, using <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a> or maybe you can, see the change logs, but is useful to manage several emails accounts. Reading the news without opening a web browser is what I like most, therefor <a href="https://newsboat.org/">Newsboat</a> is the Yellow one. </p>
      <p>In a old 32bits computer everything works just fine. Could be the New generation ones, and with one single terminal window, I can use everything I need to use a computer</p>
      <p>Computer read and process information. The same as you, but you can question it.</p>
