      <p>Sites taking several seconds to load. Sites that consume hardware resources when reading a single HTML page, without being logged in, sites that don't load in terminal applications like w3m, are those sites I don't wish to read. The content you share can be the best, but since is not readable from terminal applications, like this site is, i reject to visit your site or to use your services. The web is getting insane, and each day I like the old fashion style of sites made with HTML only. For example, I setup CSS for all pages in all subdomains on this site, but you can read all without CSS dependency. If you implement JavaScript or other technologies that able me to read the content, I can accept it. Everything else is "blarggggg.. what the heck is happening here?"</P>
