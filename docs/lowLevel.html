      <p>Is amazing how people around the, just copy what others do, making them a copy of what already exist, removing from themselfs, what is original on them, sometimes demonstrate shame for not being the same. That is a WRONG choice my friends, because copies are futil and stupid, when they are not a product that many wish to have, as being a copy of something else. </p>
      <p>I am not always paying attention to the logs of visits or attacks attempts, but when I do I think: Does these people think or they just copy without thinking? What a boring life they need to have, to unable them to be creative and original. Maybe they live in a "world" where all mistakes done by them, will result in punishment, and since all systems in the world that use that technique to teach, are all the same copy of all others, I feel low to see how you are unable to be happy. </p>
      <p>I am really sorry that you were victim of stupidity from the ones who should think twice before taking an action of education on you, but what can I do? Well, I can tell you that some behaviors are not good and even if you think that no one will find you, I can describe in details few things about you. Your IP, Your OS, Your Geographic Zone, Your City and I even could try to scan your computers to find some vulnerability and exploit it, to change the background of your screen to be "Odicforcesounds" page. Then I could configure your system to force you to visit my sites, unabling you to visit other sites. :») </p>
      <p>You see, is not a virus or worm. Is just a technique to grow the number of visits on my sites. I wouldn't take from you, any of your personal data and sell it in the internet very cheap, like "1€" for everything. Others hackers wouldn't care about your "dream" of being a hacker without reading the logs, but since you like to do the same, I think that your be fair. Not my problem. </p>
      <p>/content/, /include/, /admin/, /wp-admin/, /wp-includes/, /adm/, /wp/, etc... This persons think that the only way to build sites is by using popular frameworks. LoL </p>
      <p>Just do a favor on you and use your hand to estimulate yourself and be happy! If you like, You can use your own fingers to be even more happy! LoL </p>
