      <!--       BODY -->
      <p>Is not Guns, is not Bombs, is not Missiles, is not Planes or any flying machinery, is not Tanks and it's propose is not to kill someone.</p>
      <p>Internet, Firewalls, Tor and all the IT mechanisms that do some defensive functionality, while being private, which is safe. I think that Military groups are the first ones to experiment "new technologies", as Drones are being used for, while Goverments prohibe them at the same time. LoL, Anyway, Tor networks can be safe and private, Internet can be safe and private (if you don't login in any website like Google, within your browser/phone and by deleting your own history-of-activity). Firewall are amazing for having your own Web service and naturally, Computers and many other Electronic (bodies with electricity(like we are)) doing some specific action.</p>
      <p>I really dislike the tools that are made to kill living beings, while I like this last ones that are defensive, while can kill <b>processes</b>.</p>
      <p>If we think deeper, all living beings are as well, <b>processes</b> doing something that was "planed" by what is not possible to define. We can say that "the plan" was what each living being, was thinking to archive, while in a perfect condition they could reach that "dream". I guess that birds, dogs, cats, pigs and all other livings beings, they need to recognize other living beings, while if each make an association of desire or fear, it means they are conscient of what the other living being, represent.</p>
      <p>Is perfectly linked to my <a href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/License/index.html">Eternal License</a>. You can "behave" in a Military way, without killing any living being to archive your military gold.</p>
      <p>By killing livings beings we don't solve problems, since in technology, when we kill a process we restart that <b>process</b> again and for all livings beings, we cannot, since each, represents something unique.</p>
      <p>As I wrote in <a href="./dreamer.html">this</a> publication, I don't really believe that prisons are the only way to change behaviors, while I must admit that some <b>living processes</b> of the <b>operating system</b> called <b>Earth</b> are not easy to change the <b>source code</b>. So, for those specific examples, I agree that we should <b>exclude</b> that <b>process</b> from all others, while I can be wrong, because the way education aims to create change, is in fact, by promoting and practicing the "correct behavior", over and over again, until that information is written in Memory and become the first choice for being the self.</p>
      <p>Maybe the Systems are a bit confused about their own skills to understand what is their propose in Life.</p>
