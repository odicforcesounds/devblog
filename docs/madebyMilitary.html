      <!--       BODY -->
      <p>Is not Guns, is not Bombs, is not Missiles, is not Planes or any flying machinery, is not tanks and it's propose is not to kill someone.</p>
      <p>Internet, Firewalls, Tor and all the IT mechanisms that do some defensive functionality, while being private, which is safe.</p>
      <p>I really dislike the tools that are made to kill living beings, while I like this last ones that are defensive, while can kill <b>processes</b>.</p>
      <p>If we think deeper, all living beings are as well, <b>processes</b> doing something that was "planed" by what is not possible to define.</p>
      <p>By killing livings beings we don't solve problems, since in technology, when we kill a process we restart that <p>process</p> again and for all livings beings, we cannot, since each, represents something unique.</p>
      <p>As I wrote in <a href="./dreamer.html">this</a> publication, I don't really believe that prisons are the only way to change behaviors, while I must admit that some <p>living processes</p> of the <b>operating system</b> called <b>Earth</b> are not easy to change the <b>source code</b>. So, for those specific examples, I agree that we should <b>exclude</b> that <b>process</b> from all others, while I can be wrong, because the way education aims to create change, is in fact, by promoting and practicing the "correct behavior", over and over again, until that information is written in Memory and become the first choice for being the self.</p>
