      <p>I like to talk about the examples I read most, while I am very simplistic in the way I speak about it, I only wish to pin up small details that are common to everything and everyone. </p>
      <p>A Human baby, someday will become a men / woman.</p>
      <p>They can deny all their past and reject everything that they didn't like, while everything they are, they are in the condition of inclusion of everything they like and dislike. </p>
      <p>I think I already wrote something like this in some other post of this blog, but once again, I see the subject something interesting to think and explain. </p>
      <p>Some movies about China and Japan Kungfu cultural practices, where the student deny or refuse to continue being a student to the master, and in some moments, challenge the master to a fight, to demonstrate themselfs superiors than the master. This is a common behavior within children, while is a common behavior between adults too. Sadly this events can happen, while they are "stupid", because the student is "better" in the condition of having all the knowledge that the Master gave. Without it, the student is not the best, because in this case example, the student wouldn't know how to fight. </p>
      <p>So, if you think about history, since everything we know is the transformation of the past, you know for example that Christianity is the Evolution / Transformation of Jews. Most Nazi members in history were catholic, while catholitist is based on the Bible and the Bible is based on the Torah. So, we see the same behavior in history about the "student" that denies the Master with the desire to demonstrate themselfs superior.  </p>
      <p>The Islamic Sacred Book, the Al'Quran was written in the moment, where Christianism was rulling the world, by imposing their interpretation of God against anyone who deny it, by cruxifying, torturing and killing those who deny it. In Middle East, Human commercialization was already implemented and with that, slaves. Even if (at least for me) AlQuran author, had a positive perspective that is a bit "humanistic" and "realistic" about economy, which result in the definition of a system that try to be fair to understand human fragilities, when business is the mechanism that create the Relationship, therefor we cannot deny that the inspiration of AlQuran texts, was the reality that the Author was experiencing at his Time, somewhere in Time, 5 centuries after Christianity "revolution". The Muslin are as well, the transformation of AlQuran. Arabs don't compete between each others, do they? I don't know, but hopefully not. </p>
      <p>I think that, the problem of Judeism was in their declaration of being the "Only" and "unique" Spiritual interpretation that is "True", since that choice was what create problem in Persia. The actual Iran territory that probably are Moçulman, as they where ignored by Christianity "revolution" as some "necessary target to fight against". If we think, make sense since Persia only believe in 1 God, and therefor, Persia and Jews (at that point of Time), they weren't "much different", since Christianity start to fight against all interpretations that were Pagan, which result in enslavement against severa other points of the Globe, like America, Africa and many others. </p> 
      <p>For me, is interesting to know that some of these Philosophical spiritual interpretations developed in Persia, are "dualistic", while all of them are, by the definition of "good" and "evil", since trying to define what is "good" or "evil", create by that condition what have a dualistic base interpretation, like Daoism is, like Buddhism is, while Hinduism is as well, dualistic in the same perspectives. </p>
      <p>So, if You able to think, you see that the "Olders" create transformation on the new, while some of the new feel the need to declare themself's superior than others, others didn't feel the same. This result in something very obvious, which is a conflict between those who have the desire to demonstrate themselfs superior than others, and another group that is able to live in peace, without a competitive need to be, what they believe they are. In this aspect, we can say that Buddhism continue growing without creating rejections of competitions, without declaring themself superior, since for them, the superiority is on each self who develop self control and self discipline. The skill that all militaries in the world need, to be able to kill only soldiers and protect all te civilian, while the <a href="./leadersOfHistory.html">leaders</a> of reality, can limit the area of combat, and create by that condition, a fair war. (soldiers vs soldiers -> ONLY)</p>
      <p>The Simplicity of <a href="./style_of_god.html">God</a> is in fact dualistic and that dualism is embeded in almost everything we know.</p>
