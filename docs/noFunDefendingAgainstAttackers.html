      <p>This web site have <a href="./beingFair.html">several</a> articles used to redirect attackers IPs or Attacks Paths like "wp/", "wp-admin/", "wp-include", and all possible paths used in <a href="./becauseIsPopular.html">PHP</a> Frameworks, and Hope that attackers read the message(target page) of their <a href="./mar.html">attacks</a>.</p>
      <p>I was redirecting them to some other page or to some other domain, but I finally learn that I don't need to waste my time on this. Like the article <a href="./educatingTheMonster.html">about</a> Educating the Monster, I need to accept that the Monster attack me, to be possible to educate him.</p>
      <p>It was funny think how attackers would react when they found that their IP was redirected to some page outside this domain, like wikipedia.org. In any case, redirection was a funny way to interact with attackers, but a waste of time in the productive way.</p>
