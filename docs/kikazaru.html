      <p>The 3 Wise Monkeys is a Lesson from old times. While the one who doesn't See can speak, the one who doesn't <a href="./theGardener.html">Talk</a> cannot. But the one who doesn't listen can Speak Freely. Why is that?</p>
      <p>Nothing fancy, just logic condition that create that reflection of what each one can do, with their own creativity, based on their power to imagine. Since the Monkey who doesn't listen, cannot listen what people are speaking, he doesn't know anything about what others are planing secretly. So, <a href="./tryingToFixJustice.html">Kikazaru</a> which is the Monkey who cannot Listen, can speak about what is happening in reality, because the probability of what he is speaking is that is not true, and if it is true, then we may considere "luck" of those who don't know anything about what is true. </p>
      <p>Communities around the world, speak about others or about what they are planning to do, and only those who can listen about it, know what is going on. Only the one who doesn't See (Mizaru) is a bit confused, since he have no other option to believe in what others tell him about reality.</p>
      <p>Sometimes we may think that the probability of some historical events repeatition is true, since we cannot deny that humanity keeps repeating all the bad humanity did. So, imagine that this popular event that will be in Japan culture for all Eternity it is happening again, outside Japan, within the <b>link</b> that respect what was in Time, True.</p>
      <p>If You say that Dragons are real, Mizaru need to believe on that declaration as something true, because he cannot See if that is true or not. If you say that something should not be done, the Monkey who doesn't listen, will not care about it, while we all need to learn from the mistakes we do, most of the times, ignoring what others tell us to do, is the best way to learn about what ones should do. If you tell a secret to the one who doesn't speak, believe that he will not speak, as he can listen and see, what is going on, on reality and therefor what is true or not true. Even then, he will not speak, since he cannot, which can lead us to that sensation that someone is hidding something. </p>
