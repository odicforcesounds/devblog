      <!--       BODY -->
      <p class="center">Your attacks are so week <br> 
      that I laught a lot about your inability <br> 
      to make this world a better place <br> 
      without any violence against hate <br> 
      But you continue to try <br> 
      using Old technique that will fail, is alright <br> 
      You are stoped in Time <br> 
      and You cannot become better without the light <br> 
      You only think that Fighting is the solution <br> 
      While the problem is in your inability to use Self Discipline <br> 
      a Skill that you should learn within your culture<br> 
      a lesson that is older than you think. <br> 
      You cannot hit me, with your attacks <br> 
      Since they are Old to give a feedback <br> 
      and I always see your attempts <br> 
      that are fragile like flowers trends. <br> 
      It looks like you feel offended by a Monkey <br> 
      Who like to play this little game <br> 
      where the brain is the most powerful tool <br> 
      and without using any kind of violence<br> 
      I will win this battle against all of you! <br> <br> 
      From Hong Kong to Singapore <br> 
      All I see is weekness <br> 
      Attacking texts full of imagination <br> 
      Sacred Fire of All Creations <br> 
      From America to Germany <br> 
      All Will fail against me <br> 
      While I am alone in this life as you can see<br> 
      I don't fear your ability to be better than me <br> 
      You can be, Worst than a child who refuse to learn <br> 
      You can be,  Worst than a Dog that refuse what I wish to see<br> 
      Since I declare Peace in all Lands <br> 
      Which is the Eternal Desire of God will <br> 
      Which you disrespect,<br> 
      by trying to fight against me
