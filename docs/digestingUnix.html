      <p>Like any other knowledge in the world, to those who like to consume it, reading and learning is like eating. Anyway, this is not about Unix, Linux or food, while it is. The <b>UnixDigest.com</b> author, make use of RSS, but he only share the header of his articles. I really undersand that this way, readers will visit his site, while if he share the full articles, people would read them at home, without visiting the site, but I really like the way this guy writes, which is good and bad at the same time, when I need to click the link to read the full article.</p>
