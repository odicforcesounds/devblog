  <title>Banking problems about Google Services</title>

<body>
<h1 class="title1">Google vs Banks</h1>
<p>I take some much time to create an app (which is not complete, yet),
and <strong>Google Payment</strong> is against payments that are not
banks.</p>
<p>My bank is against most payments that are from online companies,
which include Google :)</p>
<p>So, solving another problem with this kind of incompatibilities
between giants:</p>
<p>Application will not be in <strong>Google Store</strong> or
<strong>Apple Store</strong>. ( Free for me and for everyone else)</p>
<p>Binary (<em>.apk</em>) will be stored in Github releases.</p>
<p>Solved.</p>
