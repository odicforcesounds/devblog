      <p>My country is a piece of Land in Planet Earth. Your Country is the same. Different cultures, different architecture, languages, parties, celebrations, etc.. but the condition is the same. It is just a Piece of Land.</p>
      <p class="center">As I like to think, Teachings from countries can be usefull to all others. <br>
      For example: (All Lands are Sacred and All Wall's Create Laments) <br>
      Not Only (Palestine) ....................................
      </p>
      <p> All countries can deal with the same <a href="./chinaGarden.html">Problem</a> in their Relationship with another country, but we should learn to do better, after so many centuries as a possibility to think about the past, understand the present, to understand what to do in the future, in case we want to improve what we think it is wrong, to create a better future without repeating the same mistakes we did in the past. </p>
