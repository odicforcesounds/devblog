      <p>Is amazing how a small approach to <a href="./theBestApproach.html">defend</a> against PHP attacks, almost disapear, with this small technique that I apply last night. The number of visit decrease too, but since most of them are bots, I am not surpised. I really prefer to have few readers, than a notion of having a lot, being all of them, false.</p>
      <p>I don't know if SysAdmins apply this rule I figure out in their company sites, but I see that the traffic that was growing based on this wordpress attacks, almost disapear. Naturally today I had 3, from different places, but compared to yesterday that I had about 10, is a good sign. </p>
