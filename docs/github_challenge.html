      <p>Is know, that Github is full of <b>Awesome</b> Lists of many fragments of knowledge.</p>
      <p>What is proposed here, is that the Owners of lists, create a <i>creative text</i> describing their list. Is important to be connected to the text that is already in the publication of this blog, <b>Linked</b> in the title of this publication.</p>
      <p>This publication which make reference to other publications, is free from me, to the world, without noticing them about it. </p>
      <p>Maybe I will create a Dedicated Repository, dedicated to this repository and to all others, since contributions are always welcome!</p>
