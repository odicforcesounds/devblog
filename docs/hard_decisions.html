<h1 id="hard-decisions">Hard decisions</h1>
<p>I don’t like to expose criminal activity against my sites, but when
is annoying, I have no other choice.</p>
<p>I really try to redirect attacks to my sites to <a
href="./mar.md">this</a> page, but after more than 1 week, I decided to
redirect all attacks to some police service, while that is too strong, I
decide to redirect them to my own GitHub repository.</p>
<p>This decision is based on the <a href="./false_hood.md">false</a>
idea of having a lot of visit.</p>
<p>KISS: Keep it Stupid Simple</p>
<p>Click using the mouse, don’t try to use tools to attack this
sites.</p>
<p>There is nothing more than what is exposed: No Databases, No Users,
No Emails, No dedicated-servers, etc..</p>
<p>Pure text, sometimes backgrounds and music.</p>
