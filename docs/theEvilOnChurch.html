      <p>Giving money for a better place in Heaven? You will probably accept it, if you are stupid, since God doesn't need any money, and is God decision, not Church decision. You can give 10000000000000$ per day to the Church and without your <a href="./regret.html">Change</a> you will never be Saved.</p>
      <p>Converting others beliefs, as a way to include them in the same group as a condition to be helped? More Criminality. Do you think I am unfair to tell you about the truth? Well, you can think that I am, but when you know the other two, techniques to accomplish the same objective, you will pray to have me, because I have no desire to punish you if you deny my will of choice, while all others do, if you deny their will of choice. </p>
