      <p>We could think about the military as the example, but I really prefere this image to explain:</p>

      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outflanknl/RedELK/master/images/redelk_overview.jpg">

      <p>In the above image we can see that the "Red Team Member" in inside the "White Team Member", which is like the "Blue Team Member". Like focusing in anything we wish to build, since we are focusing in building something useful, we don't see what can goes wrong, while those who are focusing in seeing what can goes wrong, are the ones that can see, by that condition of will, and in that condition, the "bad" can see what the "good" is doing incorrectly, and inform the good about what he needs to change in their code, to have a rebust and secure code, which will result in a secure and rebust application. If the Dark side was inside or behind the Light, the Dark side doesn't become dangerous but useful and a great source of information. I don't like the military example, since the tools military use, can only create one single thing. Death. They cannot create better or stable societies. They cannot create peace using them and they cannot rebirth those who die by their tools. In the other hand, coders can rebirth the tool that was terminated seconds ago, and the tools they use, are similar to the tools used on this article: (code -> Commands -> Letters and Symbols) </p>
      <p>Not a single Punch. Not a single Kick, No guns are used, no bombs, no atomic bombs, no nuclear bombs. Just letters, numbers and symbols., numbers and symbols. </p>
