Groups are the ones who can solve "challenges". All users can create challenges. 

All challenges are rated by all users, adding value to the challenge, +1 per user rate. 

All users will have a QR-code, that identify them. 

All users will have a list of "contexts"/"characteristics"/+1/-1 that can be rated by others. 

Context is the key, since we can have different choices and behaviors in different contexts, which means, we can have different quality characteristics, in different context. A person can have a "fast answer" in that context, while in another, not, since it depends on subjects as well. 

Is a way to see the value on the self, based on what other self can see on us, so we can understand the self, better. 

The final objective would be to associate a "blockchain" to this "personal characteristics" each have. 

Is like "injecting" more possibilities in Economy, since Economy depend of the value of each.
