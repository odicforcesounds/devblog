      <p>In my texts about society, I always try to write about some problem and with it, point to some solution, like in the <a href="./isNotWeekness.html">last</a> publication of this blog. I really try harder to be fair and create simple solutions, trying to block the Evil thoughts that assult me, when I read about this events that happen over and over again.</p>
      <p>But let me imagine how Evil I could be to solve the problem described in the last post.</p>
      <p>For that, I need to imagine what is not True, which is, being the Top representant of Justice.</p>
      <p>With that in mind as a possibility, everything that I declare, would be produced without any questions or doubts.</p>
      <p>So the Priest did Rate some child ah? Ok, may the Priest ASS be abused by anyone inside any prison, where Murders, Rapers and other, will live. Rape the ASS of this Priest, that did rape a child, by the condition of being unable to control their own emotions and refuse to use his hand to solve the problem. The only rule is: You cannot kill the Priest. His ASS will be there, until he die from being Old. Killing the priest would be some kind of Goodness, since with that, the Priest wouldn't suffer from the bad things that he did. The Child will remember that event until he/she gets old. The Child will have several Psychologic problems after that event. So, the Priest shall suffer every single day, by being abused by those who like to abuse, in the name of "God", what a Joke Your Religion is...</p>
