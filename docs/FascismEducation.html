      <p>When I was young I went to Germany, specificly Hamburg to the Anarchist Zone, with Anarchist Connections. If you know more or less what was the Political stage in Germany at that time, you know that Hamburg had several "Zones" controlled or by "Anarchist" Groups or by "Fascist" Groups. I went to Hamburg with 20 more people. We pass about two weeks in a Camping zone, far away from everything we knew. It was a Awesome vacations I must admit, while after a few days of being there, some stranger come and ask us to play footebal against his team. Connections warn us about "Fascism Groups", but we accept the challenge. </p>
      <p>We Win 11x2, which for us, without any footbal experience we were like pros, while them being pros, lose. For us it was <a href="./myCulture.html">Funny</a> moment with a lot of Joy and for them, was the most horrible experience that any child or adult can have. Their parents were assisting the game and in the end, they start hiting their children and insulting them to feel shame from losing against "non-German". In this zones at this time, events like Bomb attacks and other violent behaviors is what Hamburg was experiencing.</p>
      <p>In the next day, a recommendation was delivered to us, to leave and go away. Is what we decide to do, while we try to pass 2 days more in Berlin. Berlin at the Time was "Artisticly Amazing", since all "Anarchist" houses, had <a href="./awesome_story.html">awesome</a> grafities all over the place. So we went to Berlin by bus and after everyone was out the bus, a last girl who was about to live the bus, was blocked to live the bus by the police. She was wearing a T-Shirt of Cheguevara. So, she need to change the T-Shirt if she wish to walk on the Streets in a Secure way. Some guy folllow us until we get the final destination. Since it was with anarchist groups and in anarchist zones, that guy alone didn't try to attack us, but you could see on his face, <a href="./educatingTheMonster.html">Anger</a>.</p>
      <p>This is how in my 15 Years Old I learn about the Red Skin Codes. You know what is the difference in the clothes between fascists and red skins? Just a single detail that change, so confusions can happen all days. We were passing by, somewhere in Berlin and listen some girl screaming. It was like a entrance to the bus station but without a single light inside. When the group find that some strangers were listen, they try to attack. We just run and without knowing how, we found that Amazing Anarchist House. So we enter and warn everyone about this guys that try to attack us. The group come closer and the Anarchist to the front of the House. They didn't fight because Anarchist try to have a good Relationship with the "Left-Wing-Soldiers" of the "Left-Wing".</p>
      <p class="center">For me, Anarchists are more close to what God would like to see, than almost all believers be.</p>
