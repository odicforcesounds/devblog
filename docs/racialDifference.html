      <p>One day I found myself between many persons that are described as being "black", while persons like me, described as being white. My name is the same, but my color put me in a position of "being unique", in the middle of many others, resulting in some person saying: "Hey white guy, they are calling you", which is strange for me because I am not white, but rose, or beige, sometimes red, blue... I am the color one, not you! I answer: I didn't get so much Sun as you, that is the difference between me and you. </p>
      <p>Is good to remember you that I give this answer, smilling and with a friendly expression.</p>
      <p>I finish the conversation saying: I promiss I will get more sun and in few years, you will not call me white again, while I understand the <a href="./evilForums.html">simplicity</a> of <a href="./theObviousDiscrimination.html">language</a>, which simplify the situation to be possible to explain it, faster.. not better. :) </p>
