      <p>One day I found myself between many persons that are described as being "black", while persons like me, described as being white. My name is the same, but my color put me in a position of "being unique", in the middle of many others, resulting in some person saying: "Hey white guy, they are calling you", which is strange for me because I am not white, but rose, or beige, sometimes red, blue... I am the color one, not you! I answer: I didn't get so much Sun as you, that is the difference between me and you. </p>
