      <p>A few days ago, I wrote an <a href="./japaneseDog.html">article</a> about a github user that use a Dog as his Profile picture, while the description of his profile say he is living in Japan. Since I have like what he is doing in Github, I wrote that text, that have some truth's while have some good humor too. Then I share this post in his profile, and after a day or two, he is not my follower anymore. :)

      <p>I really think this is a funny situation, while seriously, is not funny at all, just because I can see, that they have some difficulties to deal with words, like computer programs that crash, when some 'sequences of characters' is sent / printed. Sorry, I will try to lie and say only beautiful things about your culture, just because you are too fragile to deal with words. At least children put in cause without reacting so bad just by reading them. </p>
