      <p class="center">If I am Running from my country, is because I don't like my country, else I would be where I am from, for all eternity.</p>
      <p>I really think that the majority of cultures that run away from their origins should embrace the New culture that Open the Doors to recieve the New, as a place that they can feel safe. In that condition, the New should learn and adapt themselfs to the culture that open their hands to the New. Is like when someone tell us that we can sleep in their house for free. Personally, I feel I need to "serve" in some way, the person that open his house for me, because it is my duty to be thankful to this person. The same when other cultures go into some new country that open the doors for them to live Free and away from the Country they are originally from. </p>
      <p>If I am German and I go to Brazil, I should adapt myself to Brazilian Culture by learning Portuguese and celebrate my own at home if I like to remember my own culture that in the perspective of <a href="./nationalPride.html">national pride</a> refuse me to be part of what I am. If I am <a href="./chinesEducation.html">Chinese</a> and I run away from China,  to go into London, I should adapt myself to the new culture by learning English and by adapting myself to that culture that open the Doors to me, so I can live Free and away, from all the Evil that my country do against their own people. If I am Japanese and I run away to India, I should adapt myself to Indian Cultures by Learning Hindy, since they open their Arms to give me the opportunity to Live Free, from the ones that are against me. If I am Spanish and I run away to France, I should Learn French and Celebrate with those who did Open their Doors to me, by celebrating with them, the cultures that they celebrate for their own. If I am American and I run away from America into China, I should Learn Chinese and Celebrate with these new people that Open their Doors for me, the cultural parties that do for themselfs. If I am ET and run away from another Galaxy into this one, I should adapt myself to the ones that Open their door to give me this sensation of being free. If I am from Iran and I run away from Iran into Italia, I should Learn Italian and celebrate with Italian people what they celebrate by their own culture, even if I need to change my religiosity or beliefs, since the original country reject me.</p>
      <p>If You don't like to country that enable you to be and Live Free, run away from that country too, since by refusing to adapt yourself to the new culture, is a Disrespecful attitude from You.</p>
