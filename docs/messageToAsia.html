      <p>I born far away from Asia. I didn't have a asian cultural education in any detail of it. In a Christian society I born and was educated, far away from Buddism, Taoism and Hinduism. Sometimes I feel myself Asian, in this symbolic relationship that can explain everything, in a very simplistic way of all. Sometimes I just think that everything I am creating, is not so good, while if is about <a href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Dao/index.html">memory</a>, make sense that repeats. I guess this country I live had some "absolutism", as part of it's own history, but I am the only one here, which is what make it fun for me. </p>
      <p>Maybe I will get crazy since I believe that God did like me, giving me the oportunity to try to solve a historical problem, that we cannot destroy, because is flowing in memory. Is just a theory,  that become a bit more than a simple theory, when you feel it. Without the ability to feel, no "mystical theory" is possible to be real. So, here I am alone, trying to deal with history, pointing into the direction of education to provide conscience, as the unique necessary instrument to create change and good vibes in the perspective of each one self conscience. </p>
      <p>The biggest lesson is the behavior or the choice, we are doing. Maybe this expression associated to odicforcesounds is not the best, or the better and it can change, maybe is not positive while I see it positive, and I should change the direction of it's own funcitonality and propose.. I don't know, what any other brain that can think and imagine, create as a possibility, when reading. I only know that all this creations made by our ability to imagine, have truthness in the ones who can feel, and feeling is only that mental exercise that create an abstraction of some subject or fact, and open the self to be able to understand, and see better, why some situation happen and what can change to fix some issue that is happening, as reflection of behavior. </p>
