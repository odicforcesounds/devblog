      <p>In <a href="./BibleHub.html">Reference</a> of the last article about the Church, I speak about being Regret. But just saying "I regret my actions" it doesn't mean that you trully regret, because to be trully sorry about some evil actions we made, it is necessary to be the will in form of actions that demonstrate that, the agressor desire is to confort the Victim of his actions, in case that is possible. When Murdering is the action, the only way to be saved by God will, is to change our lifes and dedicat a full-time-job to help people that were in the similar condition of the ones they someone did kill.</p>
      <p>So, imagine that you murder someone because the person make jokes that you don't like. To be saved, you need to dedicate your life to protect  the ones who can be victim of someone like you, without your judgement against them, but by demonstrating that what they do is funny (even if you continue to see them non-funny at all).</p>
      <p>While if this murdering was something rationally thinked, the salvation can be almost impossible to archive, but possible if the murder help others in the name of his regretment, that ask forgiveness every single day of his life, until the day he will die. Nothing can be associated to Money.  </p>
      <p>For example, I will be for all Eternity in <a href="./beingFair.html">Heavens</a>, because without making any Crime, I decide by my will only, alone, to dedicate my life to this sites, that are all about "The Style of God", which is not God. It is impossible to Define God, but it is Possible the Define <a href="./style_of_god.html">God Style</a>. </p>
