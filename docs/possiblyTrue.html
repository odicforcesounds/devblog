      <p>Applications react if you don't give explicit instructions to not-react. The same with Dogs. The same with Humans. If you give explicit instructions, which include practice and repetition, of basic steps to become the source and base of it's instrumental utility. You can teach a Dog to not eat food from strangers, while you need to feed your Dog or else, by condition of being starving, like all humans can be, they fall in the "dark desire of eating what is there, since they are starving". Logic Again.</p>
      <p>Programming languages console/shells, are noisy and complex to understand how to speak with them, while if they are noisy, is because they react, adding text, that explain why the communication was incorrect.</p>
      <p><code>If you follow the instruction given in the <a href="./theHolyMan.html">man</a> pages, and use the recommended Syntax, you will be able to use this software. If you cannot copy and paste the examples given, by changing the necessary values to the ones you need, You don't know what you are doing and you should RFTM.</code></p>
      <p>Many of us, learned by repetition without knowing how to read, the instructions that enables to walk, eat, think, move, jump, run, etc. </p>
      <p>If any of us, would have to be teached how to produce the above listed actions, only few in Human History, could survive more than 5 minutes in Life.</p>
      <p>We learn by repetition and what we can learn by reading, it is in the "Superficial" level, since is in the "abstract" world, where imagination is flowing without any direction, all in all directions, but nothing change in reality. The test of what can be true or false, need to happen, so we can verify knowledge.</p>
      <p>Only after knowledge verification, we should react. Before knowledge verification, we shouldn't react. Did you validate and verify all the knowledge that you think you have?</p>
