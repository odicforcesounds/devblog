      <p class="center">Wine, Coffee and Tea.<br> 
      Wine is for special moments, <br> 
      Coffee for every morning <br> 
      and Tea before going to sleep.</p>
      <p class="center">I don't know what is happening to me <br> 
      As all I wish is to see peace, <br> 
      while the world is always in deep violence <br> 
      As I can see on the news around the world <br> 
      Without the ability to celebrate <a href="./myCulture.html">life</a> <br> 
      in a peaceful <a href="./style_of_god.html">style</a> like any child would like <br> 
      it is what I can imagine, not what is right, <br> 
      since Games full of violence is what children play <br> 
      a Sad love story that ends with all might. <br> <br> 
      At night we dance and have Fun <br> 
      At day we work to make things done. <br> 
      This is not a poem to the Dragon mind <br> 
      It is a river of letters <br> 
      following our the Eternal Might<br> 
      of those who may dream about me <br><br> 
      Without knowing anything about the "he" <br>
      I ask myself,<br> 
      How can you see who I am? <br> 
      And the answer is simple <br> 
      It is the effect of Tea running on me
