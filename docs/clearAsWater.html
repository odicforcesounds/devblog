      <p>There are the "Good", that do bad and the "Bad" that do good. Is not always like this, but you may think "what it is". Governments and others are the "Good", but they show them self's, violent and agressive when they wish to fix something, while the Activists are the "Bad", but they show them self's, peaceful and open to fix something in reality. For all eternity and for all past from history, we will be <b>Tools of Expression</b> to <a href="./style_of_god.html">God</a> and the only thing that God cares, is about each one choice, since is what God gave us, and is what all spiritual and religious groups and individuals, believe. <br> <b>FREE WILL OF CHOICE</b></p>
      <p>
      Just another publication from a bad guy in the eyes of the good. <br> 
      Just another message to the public, that can think like I do. <br>
      Thinking is good, while time past faster, since the mind is working. <br>
      Just another theatre that the good will do, to hide all the bad. <br>
      If this was a poem, <br>
      I would need some fund, <br> 
      but I don't need it because this is fun. <br>
      Monkey playing alone <br>
      is what any child should learn. <br>
      while all of us have some child inside <br>
      alone
      </p>
      <p>I don't know what you think you are, but I am no God, just a simple Monkey, no better than any men.</p>
      <p>Strange facts about USA and others: America and Trump declare "war against narco trafic" and they show a video exploding a boat in the middle of the sea. <br>
      Is logic that, the traffic of any kind of product goes into some direction, because someone ask and pay for it. If they are able to explode a boat that is in movement, they should follow the boat until the destiny, wait and investigate, but once again, the "Good" have this kind of bad attitude. Why should the "police forces" investigate who is asking and paying "narco traffic", if they can kill their employees? If you don't pay narcos to do some job, they will no do a job, for free. Is about logic! Those who own big amounts of money will continue to pay more to ask more. Is about Logic. </p> 
      <p class="center">The Child Inside</p> 
      </p>
      <p>How many wars did happen before Alcohol was something common in USA? Governments should learn that, for everyone is all about the experience, and when something is going into a bad direction, we need to make good approachs to be able to solve the problems without being violent, even if the problem is using violence. For all of problems that show them self's, naturally violent, using violence against it, should only happen as a feedback of that violence, while You can neutralize the enemy without killing.</p>
      <p>People consume drugs, because they wish to not because someone impose that decision on them. You just need to control it or educate choices. To control it, you need to legalize it, to educate you need to inform. The best choice is always to control and educate at the same time, but everyone do "what each knows" what to do. </p>
      <p>I know we always have something more to learn, since Scientists use books to solve problems, not guns or bombs, while guns and bombs, are made by scientists too. </p>
      <p><b>Some Curiosity:</b> Most Spiritual Persons, including Priests, Like Alcohol and other types of Drugs. Is about the experience, that each can have, while each know the effect, they keep doing it, since is not about "how bad can happen to them" but "how good that experience can be to them". Even Soldiers and other type of "problemátic minds", did take some drugs to "clear the mind", and being able to become "normal" to others minds. </p>
      <p><b>Another Curiosity:</b> If police just follow the traffic target and arrest the product, they don't need to arrest the person, since they didn't finish their work. You can tell them, "Go home, we where faster than you" (your mission did fail and our mission didn't) </p>
