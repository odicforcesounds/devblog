      <!--       BODY -->
      <p>I didn't test it, but I think is interesting that a Linux project declare to be "different" from all others, because they include the Bible.</p>
      <p>How many Christian people develop in Linux projects?</p>
      <p>I don't know, but I suspect that the majority is.</p>
      <p>Anyway, I like the project just because they use Linux.</p>
      <p>This days, Christian Services are super Expensive, [Or maybe is just their buildings, that were sold to some private company].</p>
      <p>It Looks that they sold their Image, so what present it self as a Christian building or company, group, can be or not what we see.</p>
      <p>while hopefully, since this guys are from Brazil, they have a better notion that Christian services, should always be Free</p>
      <p>You already have voluntairs, that are "free", and using Linux, is Free too. So.. Looks good, while hopefully they share something with the people who give their time to build something together.</p>
      <p>Is not about the *money*, while it is. Sharing something good is as well a way to pay, or exchange a retribution to those moments of Work.</p>
      <p>Maybe some day we will see many other Linux distros, declaring them self's, different from all others, based on what they believe.</p>
      <p>Maybe I need to create my own Linux Distro! MonkeyOS :)</p>

      <p>What ever each one or group believe, if computers give you the opportunity to create something better for the group, I am with you!</p>
