      <p>Isn't curious that the "United States of America" are not so united with other states of America, like the name describe? Therefor they should change their name to "small-union-of-america", because all other that don't speak English, are not included.</p>
      <p>But I like this idea of union and I thought that we should remove states, countries, nationalities, politics, God and Religions. The idea of puting everyone together by the name of something common to all, without exception. In the name of Life, in the name of music in the name of math, in the name of creativity, peace, love, harmony.. </p>
      <p>In history, Music had some awesome results in the name of their love to the music they do. Some peace was create in the name of peace, not in hte name of some country, political group, religion(even if Christianity try, <a href="./isThisTrue.html">without</a> trying), while God doesn't Care to what choice we make because he gave us the FREE WILL OF CHOICE. So everything that can happen in reality is not by God will is by Man will. Even my own experience is about my will, not God. God just send me some crazy knowledge about the "The Way", which is <a href="./style_of_god.html">The Style of God</a>. Everything continue in the hands of Man, not in the Hands of God, and it will be like this for ETERNITY.</p>
