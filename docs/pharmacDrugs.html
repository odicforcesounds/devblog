      <p>This is what I get few days ago. First days I thought that was something that would disapear in the next days, so I ignore the pain. After a few days, the pain gets hard and my leg swelling. In this cold days, the pain was ever harder and harder and I think to myself: I will ask help to some of my friends that are physiotherapist. Then the guy came and apply some needles in my leg with acupunture techniques. I feel better in the next day, but after 2 days the pain was getting worst and my inability to do normal things like going to piss, was like hell. I give a try about this alternative medicine, yes I did, but for me was not making things better. Then some other friend call me and tell me: I can go there and take you to the hospital, so you can see what the heck is going on with you. She knows that I rarely ask help to anyone and for anything, but like any good friend do, she push things harder and convince me to go into the hospital. I think I had some luck, since I wait only 2 hours or so and after they do the exams that were needed, they told me that I had nothing broken on my foot and I just need to take some pill to treat the Tendonitis and some painkiller.</p>
      <p>Today is the secound day, and I already feel better. The painkiller could kill 90% of the pain and the anti-inflammatory will make the necessary change in a efficient way. This drugs are awesome and I don't care  if you are against them. The pain was really hard and these days I can walk better. I can sleep better and I can walk at home without too much pain. I can cook, clean the plates or the floor, without anyone help. I feel in peace and I am glad that these drugs exist.</p>
