      <!--       BODY -->
      <p>By nature of Languages, they all create Discrimination of information, to be possible to talk about specifications and singlarities. Don't be offended, if you are discriminated, since by nature of all languages we all can be discriminated in some aspect of criticism, from those who use their eyes and their tung, using this obvious technique that is part of how we talk and think. In fact, what hides in discrimination, is the qualities that were used to describe the difference between each, while all objects and subjects can have different appreciations based on each human that can appreciate those objects or subjects. So, is like saying that Gentoo is better than Debian or Debian is worst then FreeBSD, or dogs are better or worst than cats. </p>
      <p>Words don't change reality, and if they do, that is the <code>Effect of Your Imagination</code>!</p>
      <p>White persons are "rose" or "red" or "beige", and the majority of black persons are brown, bright or darker, but brown!!</p>
      <p>What history show is, the technique used by the "black" against the "white" discrimination, was to create a "proud to be black" movement.</p>
      <p>Old knowledge, with more than 60 centuries say, that to deffend from <b>verbal attacks</b>, we can ignore them or assume them.</p>
      <p>The "black movement" could ignore it, but at least, could create an answer that is fair to use against any provocation, that "touch our soul".</p>
      <p>I don't believe that persons need the Military Education to learn how to control the self, because the majority of those who take that eduction, didn't learn the lesson and therefor, react to provocations.</p>
      <p>What a provocation is after all?</p>
      <p>Provocations are made of words, but sound too. The technique in Humor, demonstrate it all: You can be offended in words, but make us laught, while if the sound is expressed in some "intense vibration", even words of love, "sound bad", and the rejection of those words are based on "how they were spelled", not "what words were used".  </p>
