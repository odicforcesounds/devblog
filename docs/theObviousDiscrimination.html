    <h1 class="title1">What Discrimination is?</h1>

      <!--       BODY -->
      <p>By nature of Languages, they all create Discrimination of information, to be possible to talk about specifications and singlarities. Don't be offended, if you are discriminated, since by nature of all languages we all can be discriminated in some aspect of criticism, from those who use their eyes and their tung, using this obvious technique that is part of how we talk and think. In fact, what hides in discrimination, is the qualities that were used to describe the difference between each, while all objects and subjects can have different appreciations based on each human that can appreciate those objects or subjects. So, is like saying that Gentoo is better than Debian or Debian is worst then FreeBSD, or dogs are better or worst than cats. </p>
      <p>Words don't change reality, and if they do, that is the <code>Effect of Your Imagination</code>!</p>
      <p>White persons are "rose" or "red" or "beige", and the majority of black persons are brown, bright or darker, but brown!!</p>
      <p>What history show is, the technique used by the "black" against the "white" discrimination, was to create a "proud to be black" movement.</p>
      <p>Old knowledge, with more than 60 centuries say, that to deffend from <b>verbal attacks</b>, we can ignore them or assume them.</p>
      <p>The "black movement" could ignore it, but at least, could create an answer that is fair to use against any provocation, that "touch our soul".</p>
      <p>I don't believe that persons need the Military Education to learn how to control the self, because the majority of those who take that eduction, didn't learn the lesson and therefor, react to provocations.</p>
      <p>What a provocation is after all?</p>
      <p>Provocations are made of words, but sound too. The technique in Humor, demonstrate it all: You can be offended in words, but make us laught, while if the sound is expressed in some "intense vibration", even words of love, "sound bad", and the rejection of those words are based on "how they were spelled", not "what words were used".  </p>
      <p>Naturally, we need to talk about, how the brain really work. Putting away all the scientific "bla bla bla", <b>brains</b> like <b>CPUs</b> compare information. Is in this process of comparation that we validate information, while computers, can only validate information, using comparative techniques, part of Memories. How can I validate "my" something, wihtout the memory of that something that is "mine" ? </p>
      <p>So, as You may know, I think I am a Monkey, but I know I am human. If you say I am a Monkey I can accept it or be offended, not by what you say, but how you say. </p>
      <p>This can always remember those amazing moments of good sex with that girl that burn you up. Communication can be offensive, provocative and we know, she is hidding something. That is what make Sex intense.</p>
      <p>So, to this is a provocative message to all racists: Your provocations could be awesome, if some sexual interess where between you and the target. This days, homosexuality is more accepted, while before Christianism was a common event. Think about it, because in this life, we give our self's to Time, in Time, for Time, and therefor, even of you don't have the ability to get a woman, at least assume what you wish for your sexuality. I really mean it, since there are some sexual moments that need to be provocative and offensive, caring the way is pronouced, to be more than effective.</p>
