## The Style of God

Imagination(**Knowledge**) **+** Logic(**Rationality**) **=** Application(**Philosophy**)

Which means: 1 + 1 = 1 OR 3 ÈÅì (Dao/Tao)

The **Dao** is the Path, and the [Path](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Dao_Expression/tracks/03_Path_of_the_Sun_Keepers/index.html) is simple.

Then we have the [Tao](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Tao/index.html), which is the condition. 
The condition is not always easy, but by the illusion to archive it, is possible.

Our ability to imagine is based on what we know. 
That is how we create new ideas, positive or false, but possible to create them in reality, as a image, text or static object, while this days, objects can move and even talk, with A.I. 
What ever is the Logic Path we select, we will create an expression with that, which is the [Application](https://wiki.odicforcesounds.com). 

Old knowledge that make sense to me, while the principles of creation, being part of what we can imagine, is based on the concept of **Maya** from **Hinduism**, and is in fact as well, part of how **Zen Schools** select their students. The selection is based on what students can imagine, sharing all their capacities to interpret the world. This is one of the main reasons I **love** Asian cultures and literature, while there are many others that use the same technique to educate some values. The definition of what each can imagine, is not given by the author as something concrete and objective, but something that doesn't depend on the author, but in the ability of the reader, to imagine. 

This describe what we can see in any community around the globe. Like all books are, while some books, become like "technical books", creating in individuals the need to see in reality, what is described in those books, like the **Bible**, **Quran**, **Torah** and others, do to their followers, explaining all conflicts that exist in history, about this **psychologic** event, that even scientists "suffer" from. What **Science** could do without the ability to imagine, based on the knowledge each individual have? 

Is curious that all religious and spiritual books, point to one single human [characteristic](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Path_Of_Shields/tracks/03_The_Possession_of_Will/index.html) that make possible to any human, to create change, solutions and conflicts. Is a characteristic that enable us to **Walk the Path** of what our mind is focus in, like [Bruce Lee](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Only_Tributes/tracks/03_Bruce_Lee/index.html) would say. 

**About Freedom**: The flower in the garden can be seen by anyone. This means that the flower in the garden is from everyone. In the moment that someone wish to possess this flower and remove it from the garden, conflicts start, because everyone can feel the same, in the basic aspect of what **possession** aims to have. 

1. **Logic Thought**: Palestine cannot be owned by "someone", and by that condition, is from everyone. Like everything in this life should be, so we could leave in peace for eternity.
2. **Logic Thought**: Christ was victimized for saying the "Truth", while many others in reality are. God is **Absolute**, and absolute means, everything and everyone. Everyone interpretation of God can be true and false at the same time. Did you learn the lesson or you are just repeating the mistake?
3. **Logic Thought**: Only Islam is perfect, the Quran say. To those who want [perfection](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Deep_Random_Meanings/tracks/06_Perfection/index.html), please go into that perfect land, and leave those cultures that contradict with yours, or embrace the new, is what anyone can do, to live in peace, within any community, is by believing and sharing, those commum and cultural practices together.
4. **Logic Thought**: To win the Storm, we need to leave the storm way. Else, the storm will take us, and make us feel that we are the storm, while we are just a [fragment](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Dao_Touch/tracks/07_Fragments_You_Need/index.html) of it.
5. **Logic Thought**: Solipsism is a false Philosopical theory, but we all live in that condition.
6. **Logic Thought**: The Unique **Divine** characteristic we all have is the **Will**. Without it, nothing is done, nothing is created, nothing can change.
7. **Logic Thought**: If you tell a lie about me, I will not get offended. If you tell some truth that I wish to hide from everyone, I will get offended. So many people putting others in Court, by being offended, while the Justice system defend them. Question: Is my impression or the Justice system is getting corrupted, because they don't think about how the brain works? Those who get offended are hiding something!
8. **Logic Thought**: The Christian say: My book speak about the truth and all others, don't, while all others say the same from all others. Are you serious or you are just competing? 
9. **Logic Thought**: Words don't change reality. You are gay! You don't become gay just because I say. The world is a rectangle. The world doesn't change it's form, just because I say it. You are the most intelligent person in the world. No, You don't become the most intelligent person in the world, just because I say it. I am a Monkey. No, I feel like a Monkey but I am a human. Transsexual persons feel they are woman, but they are men. etc... Words don't change reality!!! 
10. **Logic Thought**: "God is good but kill us all. The devil is bad, but make us laught." God is good, when God knows how to deal with denials. God is bad, when react to those who deny His will. You are not a god, but you can behave like one. This is the most important lessons from the Bible. The "good", become bad when reacting to those who deny their will and the "bad", become good, when someone punish them,  just because they deny someone else will. How many persons in history, punish others, just because they deny others will? Just open the newspaper and see for yourself, more examples. So You didn't learn the lesson. You keep repeating the mistake. If you want to be like a God, you need to go into the Military services and be in the higher position. Then you can make choices and no one can deny them without being punished. ( what a Joke ) - Human Psychology Manipulation from old Times until this days. 
11. **Logic Thought**: If everything humanity did create, was based on it's ability to imagine, then we can assume that God did create the universe by the same condition, while humanity need to learn by doing mistakes, God already know how to create without making mistakes. Based on this idea, we cannot deny God [existence](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/tracks/06_Dominated_by_Time_Ruled_by_Desire/index.html). God is dreaming about me while did create me. The same about you. [We Came in Peace](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/tracks/01_We_Came_in_Peace/index.html)

As I like to say:

- Let the Heart chose the Path, but use the Brain to walk the Path.
- The Heart want to control everything, to own everything, while by logic, we cannot."
