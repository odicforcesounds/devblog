      <p>Robots are the <a href="./ChinaBusiness.html">Best</a> solution to solve wars. Robots don't need to breath and therefor they can move and do what ever you "educate them to do", outside this planet. They can be in Mars or any other planet, exploding Nuclear Bombs, just for Fun, like Manga and other cool animations do, with those powerful and immmortal "living beings", they sometimes are "similar to what we can be", in "our dreams". I think it would be really fun. Is the Best Investment that humanity can do, in All History. Or maybe enjoy the simplicity of a <a href="./lichess.html">game</a> and face failure or victory, like all man or woman should, and enjoy all the battles you wish to have. Is what children can do too. After all these centuries taking simple social games by the intent to make them real, is the <a href="./style_of_god.html">problem</a> of human history. So, at least, by investing in wars outside this planet, robots killing and torturing other robots, could be a funny way to solve National (internal) problems. I already suggest that leaders can solve ther problems in a Box Ring. They can gladiate each others, if they agree that using violence against someone, is the best approach to solve any problem. At least is fair, since they agree with that approach, no problem to them to face the results. Better than Poetry. Is what God would see as "fair". I guess you are not believers, therefor, is natural that you don't care, while you can continue creating wars outside this planet. If Military people, and all others who <b>Fall in Love with Wars</b>, see this approach, which is the BEST Investment that any country in the world can do, they can go with the robots and be happy.</p>
      <p><code>If You like any violent approach, the violence will be used against you. At least you agree with it, which is Fair.</code> and if something happen to be bad, naturally you understand, which is Fair. Enjoying being what education teach us to be: "Be to others what you would like that others be with you". </p>
      <p>In the spiritual perspective, Peaceful and Conscience Religions will LoVe this solution and the world can continue as it should.</p>
      <p>If you have a problem to see a naked body, you probably have a mental disorder and therefor you should go to <b>Psychologist</b> or isolate yourself from the world that is full of nakeness. In the ultimate problem with the beauty of irregularities, kill yourself and solve the problem. God solutions are really simple. Why you should condend Art of nature if you don't like to see what you see? Why you should condend books, newpapers or magazines, if they are a bounch of letters? I think you are revealing yourself to others in that approach, but what is curious is that others can see the same and join your fight, without thinking why they feel the same. :) </p>
      <p>Just react, as non-rational-livings do. Are you sure you can think? Because thinking is much deeper than just logic.</p>
