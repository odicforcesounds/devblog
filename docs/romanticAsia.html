      <p>I always love the Symbology used in Asian cultures, but for the one I love, Asian cultures can be magic. She loves a lot of thing I don't care, but I think that Asia can be a place that she will feel safe with me. Puting away all this "craps" that I write here full of imagination and all others that are full of truthness from history, I like almost all cultures in the world, from America to Africa, Europe, India, Middle East, India and Asia. I love the creativity of cultures. For me, is where we can see how unique a culture can be, what lessons are behind, the humor, the colors the foods, the clothes, etc. All come from the Culture.</p>
      <p>This is what I normally get. Woman that normally don't like the same things I do, don't care about the things I do and they are normally "out of the box" in my own perspective. I don't care about football but she does. I don't care about Racing Cares, but She does. I dislike to see man fighting in a box ring, but she does. I really love all kind of music, but she doesn't. I really love all kind of animals, but she doesn't. </p>
      <p>You can imagine, how "terrible" my love relationships are, while I love them, the way they are. When I think about my relationships I always remember a Scorpions song with the name " <a href="https://youtu.be/4ePTwSa_fwU" target="_blank">He is a Woman - She is a Man</a> ", which sometimes for me it looks a bit true, in this aspect: I am always in my "small hole" away from any trouble and even if she isn't looking for trouble, if trouble comes, she will be there, before I can react. Sometimes I try to stop her, but she didn't like my peaceful style and therefor, she look to me and say: "go to your little fantasy room and leave me alone. I will treat this my way". O_o </p>
      <p>Here in the country I live, many woman have more courage than many man. I am a good example about it. I feel safe with her, even if she use some of the techniques that I reprove and condend, I cannot deny that all guys and girls who try to miss with me or with her, leave and didn't come back. She is really hard with everyone. With me, she is hard when I trying to prevent to happen everything I dislike. Putting away all those things, she is always cute with me. </p>
      <p>I always like to be the "Guide" of the <a href="./educatingTheMonster.html">Monster</a>. When she is starving I know she can become a monster and therefor I try to give her some sweet meal to calm down her monstruosity. I have my own monstruosity too, and she always try to calm down when the monster in me is growing. </p>
