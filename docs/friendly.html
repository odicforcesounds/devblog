<h1 id="a-letter-for-a-friend">A Letter for a Friend</h1>
<p>Hello my Friend, good to ear about you. I wish to share some thoughts
about, why we are so close while being so far. Well, I will not sell the
house so soon. That probability is lost for now, but at least I could
try to see the limits, believing in that possibility. You know about my
dreams. I am the Monkey and my lonly mission is to “save the world”.
That is my <em>Holy</em> and <em>Unique</em> condition of illusion, that
make me being alive. I keep loving to dance, to sing, to talk alone and
writting about, what ever is its own. Naturally having your stuff here
is not our unique connection subject, but what we have in common. We
love Art, we love to dance and we feel about many subjects, more or less
the same. That is the melody between us, else our relations wouldn’t be
possible, because I would deny it from the very first moments. I know
you know about this “melody” that connect us or make us, closer. I will
change the world, even being alone, in my work. Sometimes, if not, many
times, everyone can see in me, Irony and provocative expressions, but is
about my E=mc2 (Real-Time Shamanic Quest Dream), not deeper on me.
Anyway.. My message question your position about your stuff. As I said,
I just need to move them around, but I will care them the best I can for
all my life. Included Pi stuff. Monkeys can be offensive, but normally
they are peaceful animals. That is the Symbolic-Animal that connects
with my emotions and brain. I keep continue reading about my condition
and dreaming about it, while dreams can become real, as it is what most
real thing, each have. Everything else is just work and dedication. So,
by theory I am the Monkey and the Dragon, the Bird “of Fire”, the Wolf
and many other animals, in me.. in my emotions.. while Life turns on or
off, flowing emotions, since they are musical. I continue here, in this
“jail” of safeness. My home. KISS [Keep it Stupid Simple] ;)</p>
<p>The reading say something really funny, in my rational
interpretation: Monkeys were in Time, the favorite Pets of Gypsys and
Pirates. That is the reason of my “provable” real condition, that I am
testing, while dreaming about producing the dream on me” ( the one who
can speak, without being punished [Birds of Fire] ) … sadly the world
continues to punish speach freedom, and that speach can be rational
defended in a style that the majority will understand. If God choose me
to be this “object of Expression”, I will be, what I am, while being
what God wish to see in reality, that doesn’t depend on Him or on me,
but everyone conscience. The Freedom is, in that lonliness that “by his
hability to Imagine”, create the dream in Reality. I will be the “worst”
and the “best” at the same time, as reflection of Human History. Nothing
more!</p>
<p>If Time is Built within Our Selfs, then the Expression of Time, is
the Expression of Our Self’s as Result of Time it Self. I trust Your
dream, but by rationality, I can put in cause the trust between us.
Putting something in cause (questioning) is in fact the only way to
understand the limits and create the “node” that can create union or
rejection. But is really important for all, to continue dreaming,
heathly, in it’s conscience of singularity. I will be the Eternal Child.
The Monkey.</p>
