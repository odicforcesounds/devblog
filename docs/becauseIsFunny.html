      <p>As you may already know, my sites are as basic as HTML and CSS pages without any fancy logic behind to create my sites pages. No Python frameworks, no JavaScript Frameworks, no PHP Framewords, no C Frameworks, no Java Frameworks. Only HTML and CSS. Only!!!</p>
      <p>Here in my blog, I always try to redirect the IPs that attack this sites to some page, where I inform the attacker about this reality, but the results are always the same. They keep using the same PHP tool to attack this sites, so I see sometimes more than 1000 request in less than 2 seconds that try to find some "wp-admin/*" or "wp-include/*" or some "/*.php" requests from many STUPID and DUMB attackers. I am sure that these attackers are not really experts on security or in Technology. They just attack sites for fun, waiting some results without knowing what they are doing. <br><br>
      Therefor I make fun of them, because even if I try to inform them about their stupidity, they continue doing the same stupid action. I feel that I need to insult them, while my English offensive language is not big, so I can only say they are stupid and dumb. I don't wish to insult their mother because their mother is not guilty of their stupidity and I respect woman, being mothers or single woman, which would be unfair to these ladies. I could try to insult their fathers but the condition is the same. <br><br>
      What can I do? I don't know, I just wish to create another post about it, even if in this blog, you can find many other post saying almost the same. I suspect that they don't even know PHP or what PHP is. How to "echo" some text or how to make a while loop. So, I feel that I cannot spend too much energy with this kind of stupid attackers that don't use their brain. Sometimes I think I should redirect them to the Police site of their town, so they can continue attacking "me" (while attacking their Police Friends). Then I change my mind and redirect them to Wikipedia.org. After few days I remove their IP from that list and the attacks continue. Then change my mind again, and redirect them to some PORN site. Maybe they need to see some sex to change their mind, while they continue attacking the sites. :) </p>
      <p>You know, when you try to help others and they don't care, they are like the "Monkey who doesn't listen", while here they can only read. But maybe they are the Monkey who doesn't see, and naturally, they cannot read and think. Since I don't give you any opportunity to give me a feedback, you cannot talk with me, but you can write me something. But even with that opportunity, they don't send me any message. So, while I should get mad with them? I find that I don't need to get made with them. I can ignore them and make fun of them. </p>
      <p>This is what represent a FLAW in the <a href="./EthicalLawsOnIT.html">Ethical Laws</a> of Internet. People use tools without knowing what they are doing. They just add the site they wish to attack, click "attack" and wait... I don't know what they are waiting, since they don't read the logs, but yeah, this is really funny. So, here on Cloudflare, I just exclude their IPs from statistics, to see how many NORMAL users visit my sites. I cannot believe in the numbers, because 20.000 request per day is too much, for my stupid sites that can be funny to read. When I get 100 real visitors I feel I am getting some popularity, while I am not on TV or any other channels, because I do everything alone without any industry that control what I do.</p>
