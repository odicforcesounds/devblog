<h1 class="title2">Domain visits II</h1>
<p>I pass some weeks without watching the statistics of this domain.</p>
<p>I think the number of visits continue to grow, depending on the days,
mostly in the middle of the week, not in the weeken.</p>
<p>Strange, but is what the numbers say.</p>
<p>Singapore continue to explore the videos (is anyone there who
understand Portuguese?)</p>
<p>Hong Kong continue to explore all other domains.</p>
<p>Canada too, Portugal too. USA, Germany, Turkey, India, Brasil,
etc..</p>
<p>I think people didn’t register into Github, to share some comments
with me, so…</p>
<p>I continue to be the Monkey who doesn’t listen, while I can read but
no one write me a bit.</p>
<p>Enjoy the Show! :D</p>
