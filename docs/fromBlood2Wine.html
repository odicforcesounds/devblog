    <p>I don't know, how Blood become Wine, but since humanity it was always creative, maybe it was the color that
      create that Relationship. Nothing very fancy, but even if I dislike that Relationship from how Christianity
      celebrate the Death of his Loved one, while being thankful, I really like some Wine. I drink between 1 to 3
      bottles of Wine per Year, but I try to spend a bit more to feel the difference of those wines that have quality.
      It feels like you can chew the Wine and if you have some Cheese, Oh Yeah, what a relaxed days. </p>
    <p>I forgot the article that I wrote about this topic, only Christianity celebrate the Death of the Loved one. All
      others never celebrate their Death, because that would be a disrespectful celebration. I when I remember the ones
      I love that are gone. I never celebrate their Death. But sometimes I wish to celebrate the Death of those who made
      something Wrong, even if I dislike the style, because I would be giving strength to the ones I dislike.</p>
    <p>How the Body become Bread? I don't know, while even if I dislike that symbolic style to celebrate the Death of
      Jesus Christ, there are a lot of delicious bread. In Portugal, the Olders eat a soup called: "Sopa de Cavalo
      Cansado", which is "Soup of Tired Horse". (Wine with Bread - Right in The Morning) </p>
    <p>It was for many centuries a way to deal with Farming Work where the Hit was High in the morning. To be able to
      have some Positive Spirit to deal with that Hard work, people drink this "Soup" in the morning, before working.
      With a Smile in their faces, positive spirit, they work hard. </p>
    <p>I don't know why, but I see some Romantism is this Tragic approach that remember me, Love.</p>
