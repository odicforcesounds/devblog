      <p>Just for some moments, In time, to give Time, Time, to think about Time. Does Time think or Time exist because you exist? So Time depends on you. Since You think, you can give to Time, the ability to Think.</p>
      <p>I am almost fascinated with the compulsivity of some attackers against this sites. Is like when we are Compiling software. There is an excitment to see the process. There is a guy on internet, that dedicates a YouTube channel only to see the results of Gentoo command: "emerge -vNDu @world" </p>
      <p>Aren't You fascinated? I am a bit, while my new fascination  is to see this attackers that probably are having the same sensation. They have this script / software, and they use the same software over and over again, against any website. Maybe they are just in that state of fascination to see that software running, but without caring to read the results, like many can do in that YouTube channel of Gentoo. </p>
      <p>The brain have some crazy issues. Is really funny.</p>
      <p>I like to be irregular and unperfect, ugly and infantil. </p>
      <p>Teach me a lot about what I can see in reality.</p>
      <p>Learn about yourself, and you will understand reality. </p>
      <p>Is what most spiritual interpretations talk about, mainly Buddhism.</p>
      <p>Interesting. </p>
