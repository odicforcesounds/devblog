# Domain visits II 

I pass some weeks without watching the statistics of this domain. 

I think the number of visits continue to grow, depending on the days, mostly in the middle of the week, not in the weeken. 

Strange, but is what the numbers say. 

Singapore continue to explore the videos (is anyone there who understand Portuguese?) 

Hong Kong continue to explore all other domains. 

Canada too, Portugal too. USA, Germany, Turkey, India, Brasil, etc.. 

I think people didn't register into Github, to share some comments with me, so... 

I continue to be the Monkey who doesn't listen, while I can read but no one write me a bit.

Enjoy the Show! :D
