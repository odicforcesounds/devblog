      <p>But I can accept it, if the persons who going to participate, accept to participate. In any case, in my opinion, that fight will not solve any problem and what ever is decided by the <a href="./historicalEvent.html">winner</a>, is not what should happen, if the participantes choice was the solve the problem without fighting. It would result in a work that include both perspectives in one, demonstrating <a href="./respectful.html">respect</a> for the other group. </p>

      <p>Even if I don't like any kind of fight between humans, that are the ones that could make that choice, using the <a href="./usingTheBrain.html">brain</a>, I must admit that I admire Chineses Kung Fu Skills from their temples dedicated to teach Kung Fu. They really try to improve everything they already develop in Time, after so many centuries, which is nice that they are not "stoped in time", even being. Japan try to create something new even if the original inspiration is Chinese, (the same that <a href="./theGoodOnChristianity.html">Christianity</a> did with Judeism, they didn't recognize the source of inspiration), even creating something "new", which is all the Ninja codes and fight styles, that are a result as well, of creativity. <br><br>
      In the perspective of giving a good end for any martial art, is something that China do, with QiGong and other variations, that we can see in China as a popular common practice that happen on the streets. Anyway, what happen in Japan, was something different, since somewhere in Time, Japan was for the Chinese what Brazil was to the Portuguese, while the report of finding a "new land" happen from Portuguese soldiers, not within Chineses Soldiers. Only after some centuries later, China discover that his soldiers didn't give an answer, but at that time, the soldiers that were there, already develop a new language based on Chinese, being Japanese. Naturally that the development of new language and fight styles, are not the same from the original source, mainly because the people are not the same and therefor, Japan refuse the idea of being like a "son" of China. The same with Christianity against the Jews.  </p>
      <p>If you think a bit, there many other "Chinese Families", like the Korean, Malasyan and others, that go far away from the origins and develop their own cultural unicity. I am not against that development, but sometimes countries like China, feel that it needs to take other cultures as they were from China, only to "Show the world" that China is "Big". I see a Child problem here, but since all have some child inside, is natural that in the middle of "Dragon" discipline with a Obcessive Compulsive Paranoia of Perfeccionism, this behavior is on China Goverments. Even then, I don't approve it. For example the Portuguese accept to give independency to all other countries that Portugal conquer in Time, even if they continue to speak a different portuguese from the one that Portugal use in actual days, Portugal was able to accept the condition of <a href="./theTransformation.html">transformation</a> as something natural. Today we can say "The Big Empire that Portugal had is Lost", but that could only happen if Portugal was conscious about that development that create unicity. In those acts of "Goodness", Portugal accept to give independency without a competitive technique that include wars, but only "Peace". I don't know if Portugal will be able to manage Peace, but they look focused on the objective, which in my opinion is good, because it demonstrate "humanity", since Portugal is as well, a country with more than 1000 years of history.  </p>
     
      <p>Self discipline is as well, a <a href="./commonAsia.html">common</a> discipline that both, China and Japan, care to give to their children, resulting in a big number of "users" that don't fight. If in some perspectives, this is true, in some others, it is not true, since the "Triades" that I can see that are corrupted, is something very old that continue to be true. The criminal groups changed the main objective to give a direction of a business flow that show no mercy to those who do something wrong, like they do between each others for so long. In this aspect I feel sad on that development, since the original flow of the natural "Triad" was only to <a href="./beingFair.html">Defend</a> "Heaven" / "Paradise" from the ones that care only for money. So they revert all the values to be the Contradiction of everything that somewhere in Time, was "Heavens" / "Paradise". </p>

      <p class="center">This big introduction intend to demonstrate what Humility is and what Conscience is. </p>
     
      <p>Anyway, <a href="./drugsEffect.html">Drugs</a> are better than Guns. Is more moral to consume any drug than kill any man / woman. But I see that <a href="./tryingToFixJustice.html">Justice</a> around the world, see that killing is more moral than having fun with the imagination. A person who take drugs, it is experiencing what the mind create by the effect of that drug. Didn't punish anyone. Didn't kill. And lets face it, <a href="./criminalMasters.html">Governments</a> around the world just need to create a similar system that already exist for Guns(commercialization) with Drugs, and legalize the Drug dealers and investors in the legal way (not criminal) since the worst choice for the criminal, is already implemented legally, with guns. </p>
