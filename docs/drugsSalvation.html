      <p>But I can accept it, if the persons who going to participate, accept to participate. In any case, in my opinion, that fight will not solve any problem and what ever is decided by the <a href="./historicalEvent.html">winner</a>, is not what should happen, if the participates choice was the solve the problem without fighting. It would result in a work that include both perspectives in one, demonstrating <a href="./respectful.html">respect</a> for the other group. </p>

      <p>Even if I don't like any kind of fight between humans, that are the ones that could make that choice, using the <a href="./usingTheBrain.html">brain</a>, I must admit that I admire Chineses Kung Fu Skills from their temples dedicated to teach Kung Fu. They really try to improve everything they already develop in Time, after so many centuries, which is nice that they are not "stoped in time", even being. Japan try to create something new even if the original inspiration is Chinese, the same that 
      <a href="./theGoodOnChristianity.html">Christianity</a> and Judeism did, they don't recognize the source of inspiration, even creating something "new", which is all the Ninja codes and fight styles, that are a result as well, of creativity. In the perspective of giving a good end for any martial art, is something that China do, with QiGong and other variations, that we can see in China as a popular common practice that happen on the streets.  </p>
     
      <p>Self discipline is as well, a common discipline that both, China and Japan, care to give to their children, resulting in a big number of "users" that don't fight. If in some perspectives, this is true, in some others, it is not true, since the "Triades" that I can see that are corrupted, is something very old that continue to be true. The criminal groups changed the main objective to give a direction of a business flow that show no mercy to those who do something wrong, like they do between each others for so long. In this aspect I feel sad on that development, since the original flow of the natural "Triad" was only to <a href="./beingFair.html">Defend</a> "Heaven" / "Paradise" from the ones that care only for money. So they revert all the values to be the Contradiction of everything that somewhere in Time, was "Heavens" / "Paradise". </p>
     
      <p>Anyway, Drugs are better than Guns. Is more moral to consume any drug than kill any man / woman. But I see that <a href="./tryingToFixJustice.html">Justice</a> around the world, see that killing is more moral than having fun with the imagination. A person who take drugs, it is experiencing what the mind create by the effect of that drug. Didn't punish anyone. Didn't kill. And lets face it, <a href="./criminalMasters.html">Governments</a> around the world just need to create a similar system that already exist for Guns(commercialization) with Drugs, and legalize the Drug dealers and investors in the legal way (not criminal) since the worst choice for the criminal, is already implemented legally, with guns. </p>
