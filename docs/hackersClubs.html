      <p>Somewhere in Time, I was connected to some HackerSpace, where people hack each other for fun, while the main intention was to teach others how to attack and how to defend against those attacks, in the actual days, I don't know how HackerSpace work, but since their tools that cost several months of hardwork to make them work are freely exposed on Internet, anyone can download them as use them. </p> 
      <p>what was in Time, just for fun, become to some, a bit more than "just for fun", but a way to attack real users on internet, to steal their personal data and probably to try to fuck their lifes. I think this is a SAD end, since these new attackers don't even know how to use a browser, by refusing to READ the logs or to read the code of each Site, that is exposed for All. </p>
      <p>Creating software to make people stupid, is Stupid. I miss those awesome days, where we learn about many techniques to attack or defend against attacks, in the same room, where everyone was there to learn, not to steal something from others, not to fuck anyone life for pleasure. </p>
      <p>It is by this condition of Time development, that <a href="./EthicalLawsOnIT.html">Ethics</a> break the limits of what is acceptable to exist. Box Fighters, fight in a limit space. Military should do the same, but like this stupid wordpress attackers do, they just attack anyone sites, without the responsability to limit the attacks surface.</p>
