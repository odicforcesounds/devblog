    <div class="textbox">
      <!--       BODY -->
      <p>First of all, I use the Vi editor, while I cannot refuse to use Vim. I Love Tmux too, to switch my tabs for extra modifications of operations, like searching for some specific link or text. Then I have a GitHub account to upload the code and publish it in one of the subdomain repositories of this odicforcesounds.com. Since I am not using any kind of database for this content, I don't need JavaScript, Python or PHP. </p>
      <p>For each repository code I always have a Shell script to automate some repeatitive commands and all pages are created using a template.</p>
      <p class="center">The Shell script have something like this:</p>
      <p><code>
        #!/bin/bash <br>
        # Comment <br>
        git diff # check changes <br>
        pkill -x ssh-agent # terminate open ssh-agent processes <br>
        eval $(ssh-agent) # start a new ssh-agent <br>
        ssh-add ~/.ssh/github # adding SSH key to verify user <br>
        git pull git@github.com:odicforcesounds/repoName # update source from any changes  <br>
        git add . # because my commits are not technical <br>
        git commit -m "Make it Right for a better Ride" # Because is for the better <br>
        git push git@github.com:odicforcesounds/repoName # Commit changes 
      </code></p>
      <p class="center">SSH make it Private.</p>
      <p>For the HTML template, you can right-click this page to see the source. Just ignore the content of the article.</p>
      <p>So I just copy and create the HTML file by doing: </p>
      <p><code>cp template docs/newArticle.html <br>
        # and <br>
        vim docs/newArticle.html docs/index.html 
      </code></p>
      <p>Note that I could setup the temlate within Vim, for this case I just share the most "easier way to do the same.</p>
      <p>I don't need any fancy and complex framework to have my sites running, while is true that I will have some database in few. The application that I am developing is already tested and runnning, I am about to open Registration for groups, without sharing the <a href="./app_dev.html">application</a>, before Google approvement.</p>
      <p>I feel that I need to update the <a href="https://wiki.odicforcesounds.com">Wiki</a> content, to give a better idea of how this application works and what is the main functionalities. After this process complete, the application will be alive in all countries in the world and, let us see what happen. :) </p>
      <p>As explained in the <b>application</b> link content, it will use some JavaScript Framework. A dedicated server will host the database and a dedicated server to run the API code. </p>
