      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheOpenBSDguy">Here</a> is the YouTube channel that is teaching me a lot! </p>
      <p>Looks like the guy stop making videos, but I like his style, because he explain each detail, while demonstrating. </p>
      <p>It doesn't travel in the world of thoughts, like the majority do.</p>
      <p>Maybe we should ask OpenBSD to do more videos like this guy, because you can talk while doing, else you can talk.</p>
      <p>Talks are good to learn the theory, while the example is what teach us most, since is with the example that most learn, not by the theory, which is good for administration practices.  </p>
      <p>I found some awesome videos made by this guy, but never explore his channel. Then I start to write this article while exploring his channel. I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RoboNuggie">another</a> BSD guy who continue making videos, but this last one is more <b>Free</b> while the first is more <b>Open</b>.</p>
      <p>Looks simple, the difference. When you are Free, you change without any concern, when you are open, you will not change without any Big reason. </p>
      <p>Open is more conservative, and Free is the contrary.</p>
      <p>If this sound political, it is, like everything is society is, while we should pay attention to what each do great, and form a new one with those.</p>
      <p>Don't fight, create alchemy.</p>
