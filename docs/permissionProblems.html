      <!--       BODY -->
      <p>Did the Linux community ask permissions to use as a Logo an animal that exist?</p>
      <p>Did education institutes ask permissions to use animals as animated characters?</p>
      <p>I don't know, but some of this animals could feel offended, for being used for non-animal solutions.</p>
      <p>Dogs are polices? Cats are Gypsys?</p>
      <p>Pigs sniff, and they are not so durty as you think.</p>
      <p>Parrots can speak and they are not offensive or defensive.</p>
      <p>Birds can sing, without letters indeed.</p>
      <p>If I use another human to make create a comparative expression, I can have problems with that use case.</p>
      <p>Maybe we should process in court those who use animals as logos, since the comparative expression can be offensive.</p>
      <p>You look like a Dog. You look like a Cat. You look like a Pig, a Monkey and a Elephant.</p>
      <p>Maybe you should think first, about this comparative expressions, since you have a brain. </p>
