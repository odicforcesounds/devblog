<p>Always looking for <a
href="https://book.odicforcesounds.com">someone</a> help, to <a
href="https://play.odicforcesounds.com">play</a> with me this <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/tracks/10_The_Game_Project/index.html">game</a>,
I am about to build.</p>
<p>I am starting to invest my time and money, trying to build the
application, described in the audio-track <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Dao/login/index.html">Social
Tool Kit</a>, from the album <strong>Emotional Signals</strong> as a
Android application. If you click the last link, then you can see the
final objective of this application, which describe a Challenge for all
kind of groups, from public to private, industry, governments, ET’s :D
(World Wide).</p>
<p>In the <strong>Spiritual Algorithmic</strong> album, there is another
audio-track, with a description of this application, with the name <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Spiritual_Algorithmic/tracks/01_The_Challenge/index.html">The
Challenge</a>, where another tracks like <strong>Mr. JSON</strong>,
<strong>Data - Objects and Functions</strong>, <strong>Into the World of
JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Firebase - Solar Plexus</strong>, already
point to the direction of what this application need to use.</p>
<p>Developing this application, will need <a
href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a>, while storing the code
in <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> to get notification of
packages updates, managed by <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a>
and used inside this application. <a
href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> can be helpful if you know what
you wish to create, which means: what functionality this application
will have, to become a tools to someone else. “The Path” <a
href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> structure is like JSON,
and since all kind of databases, deal with data, objects and functions
exist by that condition. It looks very connected, very obvious.</p>
