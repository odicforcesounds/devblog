      <p class="center">I have new fans from Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea that try their luck attacking my sites</p>
      <p class="center">Since they all use the same technique, I am always making fun of them</p>
      <p>Security is a common topic, since is a old condition that we all live in History. By reading History books, we see how security was exploited and how this topic is important to all. Putting away the approach of how this topic was developed in the last centuries, in actual days it is developing in a different way. Then as I like to explore any subject (like different trees that monkeys like to play with), I always try to explore a bit more, about each fragment of each "tree", to understand deeply. </p>
      <p>Github is one of the most popular coding host to explore what projects are being developed, and with that, what topic we like to read and learn, since we can search by topic to see what kind of applications and documentations are <a href="./EthicalLawsOnIT.html">exposed</a> for all to use for Free. Today I found <a href="https://github.com/0xsyr0" target="_blank">this</a> guy who share a lot of <b>security</b> content to learn in a technical way, about each possible security flaw that exist on technology. A awesome <a href="https://github.com/0xsyr0/Awesome-Cybersecurity-Handbooks" target="_blank">Handbook</a> to read about, some links about <a href="https://github.com/0xsyr0/OSCP" target="_blank">OSCP</a> full of resources to explore each one <b>Red Team</b> creativity, while is always good to understand some <a href="https://github.com/0xsyr0/Cybersecurity-Glossary" target="_blank">abbreviation</a> like I use to describe the Dragon as a <b>OCPP</b>, some other <a href="https://github.com/0xsyr0/Cybersecurity-Book-Recommendations" target="_blank">recommendation</a> to follow and apply if needed, some other <a href="https://github.com/0xsyr0/Red-Team-Playbooks" target="_blank">Playbooks</a> to play with the mind, if you like to think about what you are doing, some <a href="https://github.com/0xsyr0/Havoc-C2-SSRF-RCE-Exploit" target="_blank">exploit</a> to test against your applications, some <a href="https://github.com/0xsyr0/Red-Team-Field-Guide" target="_blank">guides</a> with tips for better choices, and many other resources to explore and test, if you like this topic inside the world of technology. </p>
      <p>One of this days, I got an email from some "Muhamedxxxxx@gmail.com", asking to perform some security testing for my sites, while I am just one guy, not a company, I didn't answer because, whatever security issue I have, I cannot do much more, since I host my code on Github like all this projects are, and proxy the traffic using Cloudflare for Free. I don't spend a single coin on my sites to put them alive and I have no business behind the work I did develop these last years. But lets continue to explore a bit more about this topic.</p>
      <p>This topic is interesting to me, even if by condition I am probably a bit safe from all this knowledge that can create some damage on many others, I always like to study by reading, without <a href="./kikazaru.html">listening</a> what others tell me to do, since I cannot think and organize my thougts, only by listening what others tell us to do.</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/EvilWhales/RProxy-LAB" target="_blank">Laboratories</a> to test security of applications in a secure way, is what we can do to test and study about this topic that is a bit sensible to all others. The <a href="https://github.com/EvilWhales/Cobalt-Strike-Ultimate-Arsenal" target="_blank">Arsenal</a> of our tools, can be big and to understand how each work, takes a lot of time and research, while we can always RTFM and lose less time to understand how things work. Some of these tools target <a href="https://github.com/pwnfuzz" target="_blank">industry</a> named commonly as "Enterprise" services. <a href="https://github.com/Gallopsled" target="_blank">CTFs</a> are always good tool to see if our data was target of what we cannot fully control, <a href="https://github.com/curated-intel" target="_blank">CTI</a> tools to investigate deeper about IPs, which can be useful for me, to research about the attackers of my sites, some other <a href="https://github.com/SpecterOps" target="_blank">tools</a> that are useful to test our servers if they host some domain, and <a href="https://github.com/praetorian-inc" target="_blank">many</a> other tools that can be helpful for industry, to ensure their service is secure. The technique to read and modify values using a <a href="https://github.com/rizinorg" target="_blank">Hex</a> editor, known as <b>Reverse Engineering</b>, which declare a funny theory: "If You know Assembly, everything is Open Source". Some <a href="https://github.com/MatheuZSecurity/Singularity" target="_blank">rootkits</a> that can be used against your Linux system, some <a href="https://github.com/gophish" target="_blank">Phishing</a> tools to hack people that don't pay attention to links descriptions, some other <a href="https://github.com/trickest/wordlists" target="_blank">word lists</a> to find passwords, a big list of <a href="https://github.com/CVEProject" target="_blank">CVEs</a> to understand how exploits work in a technical way, and many other things that are interesting to read and think (in case you like to think, which is not a common choice within many). The <a href="https://github.com/screetsec/TheFatRat" target="_blank">Rats</a> always like Cheese and <a href="https://github.com/cure53/HTTPLeaks" target="_blank">Leaks</a> to find more food to eat, and use <a href="https://github.com/BishopFox" target="_blank">simulators</a> to manage the assessments of our attacks, since <a href="https://github.com/moloch--/RootTheBox" target="_blank">hackers</a> always see their learning as some game to play, and be aware of all other possiblities. </p>
      <p>I really enjoy reading about this, while I spend several hours on this readings I feel better to know about the possibilities</p>
