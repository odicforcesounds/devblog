<h2 class="title2">FreeBSD vs Gentoo</h2>
<div class="textbox">
<p>Have you ever installed <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo
Linux</a>? If you ever did, then you know how much pain you pass through
just to have your Linux box ready to serve your needs.</p>
<p><a href="./blog/distros/gentoo.html">Gentoo</a> installation is a
learning process and the worst of it, is when you need to update, which
needs to be something like once per week. If you take longer, you will
find some USE=“Flags” problems in the process, while many other problems
can happen before you even boot it from the first time. I encourage you
to try, mainly if you are a big FAN of memory usage performance and CPU
performance too. Compilation time is your best friend, and hopefully you
know to leave the computer away for some time, when compiling software.
For exemple, to compile <strong>GCC</strong> that may take several
hours. Anyway, when you boot your <strong>Gentoo</strong> for the first
time, in case you already <strong>compile the kernel</strong> from the
<strong>source</strong>, which you specify which
<strong>hardware</strong> you have and which <strong>software</strong>
compability you wish to have, the software you install, will be at its
best, for your machine <strong>characteristics</strong>. In the other
hand, in the last years, Gentoo implement <strong>Binary</strong>
packages, to save your <strong>Time</strong>. While Time is saved, you
cannot change the default configuration of the package you install,
because was made to have all <strong>features</strong>, not only those
you need.</p>
<p>By default in <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>, you may
wish to use <strong>ZFS</strong> partition shema. It will take some
memory from you, but if memory is not a problem, continue with ZFS. If
Memory is a problem, please choose <strong>UFS</strong>.</p>
<p>With <strong>FreeBSD</strong>, installation is super easy and no
problems will come for installing it in your machine (mostly). After
that super-fast installation, you can think you are using Gentoo.
FreeBSD <strong>ports</strong> have everything you need to start. Use
the <strong>whereis</strong> command, to find the programs you wish to
install and go into that directory, and install them all, using the
<strong>make</strong> command. But wait, before installing anything you
should <strong>compile the kernel</strong>. The kernel you are using is
<strong>generic</strong> and what you need is only the
<strong>code</strong> that make your hardware work. All other hardware
devices that you don’t have or use, can be removed, which will results
in a faster kernel. You can start with <strong>GCC</strong> if you wish,
to remember how much time it takes in <strong>Gentoo</strong>, while
<strong>FreeBSD</strong> will ask you so many questions in the process
of installing one single software, that you can quit from installing it
from the source. Even if you can use <strong>pkg</strong> package to
install the binary versions, you can escape that annoying problem with
<strong>make BATCH=yes install clean</strong>, but keep in mind that
some packages have non-desired features included, so you may wish to
investigate the <strong>Makefile</strong> of each package you wish to
install, to be sure that you will not install, what you don’t need. For
example <strong>Vim</strong> will install the <strong>X</strong> server.
In my perspective this is completly insane, but what can I do against
it?</p>
<p><strong>Offend FreeBSD developers</strong> :)</p>
<p>So remove the <strong>gtk2</strong>, <strong>gtk3</strong>,
<strong>motif</strong> and <strong>x11</strong> from
<strong>Makefile</strong>. This is about the
<strong>/usr/ports/editors/vim</strong> package, but others can have
different packages that you don’t need. For example
<strong>samba</strong> or <strong>smb</strong>, which is to manage
<strong>Window$</strong> filesystems, <strong>telnet</strong> which is a
non-secure communication, while can be useful, you can try the secure
approach, using <strong>ssh</strong>. To simplify the problem of editing
the <strong>Makefile</strong>, use the command <strong>make
config</strong>. As another popular example you may wish to install in
case you are building a server is <a
href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache2</a>. You may wish to remove all
the <strong>CGI</strong> modules to be sure that have no known
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Another awesome feature is that, some packages can be
<strong>Flagged</strong> as <code>Vulnerable</code>, mainly when you are
trying to compile them from the source. If this happen, compilation will
break / stop and some message will be described to “jump off” the
problem, which is by adding the option: <strong>make
DISABLE_VULNERABILITIES=yes install clean</strong> to continue. I am not
sure about the sensation I have when compiling from source, but I think
the compilation time is less than Gentoo, while I need to tell you the
true: The Truth is, I start compilation and leave computer for some
time. The Bike and the Road are always good friends to forget Time.</p>
<p>In case you wish to install something that have deeper dependencies,
you may wish to use the command <strong>make config-recursive</strong>,
to select the compatibilities of all dependencies, before compiling
them. If you think this ncurses-popups are annoying, try to <strong>make
install clean</strong> without any extra option, and you will see the <a
href="./the_beauty_of_the_ugly.html">hugly</a> side of FreeBSD
<strong>ports</strong>. To enable <strong>services</strong> that you
install at <strong>boot time</strong>, like the
<strong>ssh-server</strong>, you need to add it to the
<strong>/etc/rc.conf</strong> file. For example:
<strong>apache24_enable=“YES”</strong> or <strong>dbus_enable</strong>,
<strong>ssh_enable</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>So, the <strong>lesson</strong> of using FreeBSD is to use this last
tips before installing or editing the Makefile of each package from
<strong>/usr/ports/</strong>. And always <strong>clean</strong>. If you
like to explore more, please check the <strong>Jail</strong> system and
the <strong>PF</strong> Firewall. If you wish to build a
<strong>Desktop</strong>, I should remember you that the list of
packages to install is <strong>Big</strong>. This article is like a
motivation to learn more about FreeBSD freedom. I don’t really care
about the <strong>licenses</strong>, but the usability that gives an
opportunity of it’s experience. Nothing more.</p>
<p>I don’t know why, but Gentoo <strong>Port</strong>age refers to
FreeBSD/ports and to Arch/ports. The older is the original, which is
Free to make fun of it.</p>
