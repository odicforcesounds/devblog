      <p class="center">Everything is Politics, since politics are about choices of singularities.</p>
      <p>Normally by the "default" development of political perspectives, the Right-Wing focus on Economy and Security and the Left-Wing focus on Education and Health. The main 4 "Pilars" that need to exist for all, splited in two different groups, that develop several ramifications of the original source, with new interpretations about what was in Time, new.</p>
      <p>Man and Woman are (different), therefor the Right-Wing and the Left-Wing are different, while Both are part of the same Body that they Serve as instruments to move, like <a href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Dao_Expression/tracks/09_Birds_of_Fire/index.html">Birds</a> do. In actual days and for long time, Political groups around the globe and in History, didn't learn how to Love, because they pass their lifes competing, to demonstrate which one is the best and which one is the <a href="./youAreSoWeek.html">week</a>. It looks that they are always like that, without understanding that both need to work together to be able to move the body of the bird that they work for, and by that condition of "working together for one single purpose", it will be their experience of Love. To love is to be able to retribute and think how both can do what both dream, without fighting, since in Love, there is no superiority.</p>
