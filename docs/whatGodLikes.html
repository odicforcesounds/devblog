      <p>Is in this chaotic system that the nature of God happen, where the self aims to find something else, while can be someone else.</p>
      <p>The nature of <a href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Path_Of_Shields/tracks/01_Because_we_Love/index.html">Love</a>, that happen without planning, while both beings are open for that possibility, from cats to humans, ants and spiders, they all have that information written in their body, so they create the common function that all living beings have in this planet, while everything else that humanity create or discover, is a mix of many other components to create one single object. So as you can see, God love that organic flow where nothing is alone. Even water without movement and without livings beings, from there, new living beings will exist, somewhere in Time, without a plan to create them. This is a good reason to think that I will fail with my application, while is true that I have no plan to put more people, using it. :) Well, in fact my plan is described in the main site, which is asking world wide help, to built it, while I will present the "prototype" and first version, to be able to have an opportunity to have a feedback. </p>
