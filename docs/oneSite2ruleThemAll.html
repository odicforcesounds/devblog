      <p>This is how I feel, when exploring OpenBSD site. Each "invention" have it's own site, it's own documentation pages, while being integrated in one single one project. This is a bit confused to me, while I can understand the way that each group develop and maintain solutions, I don't understand why they don't join them all in one single domain or subdomain.</p>
      <p>It could be something like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.libressl.org/">lets.openbsd.org</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openbgpd.org/">bgpd.openbsd.org</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rpki-client.org/">rpki.openbsd.org</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openntpd.org/">ntpd.openbsd.org</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opensmtpd.org/">smtpd.openbsd.org</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openiked.org/">iked.openbsd.org</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://mandoc.bsd.lv/">mandoc.openbsd.org</a>, while they share Artworks and Music made by them, which is really nice, many other articles that we can find in Internet, could be incorporated as extra documentation, to help the newbies like me. :) </p>
      <p>After a few days, I found that the <a href="./theHolyMan.html">man</a> pages are in fact, from OpenBSD.org :) </p>
      <p>Reading a bit about this group, we can understand that they like creative works, while being very <b>obsessed</b> with <b>security</b>. Since is focus on passive-security, is what make this project, useful. The man pages of OpenBSD are amazing, while is not easy to get up and running. I am not sure about how my <i>pf rules</i> are. hopefully they will work, since they look a bit simple then IPTables. The firewall is already working, while serving a HTTP service, don't have httpd enable and I didn't install any other HTTP server. So, yes, the routing is working as expected, since the HTTP server is in another network, using a different IP, isolated from my LAN. </p>
      <p>I am feeling like the first moments I try Linux, 30 years ago. Everything new, everything a bit complex. The manuals and the relation of all components <a href="./dreamsVSreality.html">dancing</a> together. </p>
      <p>Reading is always good, while testing is a bit better. </p>
