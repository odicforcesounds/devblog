      <p>The culture of technology is culture because many remember the past of computers and other technologies. The Abaco is part of that history. From objects "found" in the past, to music and dancing styles, is what culture can give to all cultures. That unicity that is different from all others, even the closer ones. This means something very interesting but obvious at the same time. We all copy something from somewhere, while each, personalize the copy, creating another copy that is different from all others. Cultures is those fragments of creativity that were build to remember the past, since the present is the continuity of the past, the present needs to be, the past flowing in peace. I think all cultures normally dislike when someone make fun of them. All cultures feel the same, while all and each, should learn to ignore and make fun of those who make fun, to make a funny party at the end of thise experience of living... and create using imagination, the source of creation. The Sacred Fire. </p>
