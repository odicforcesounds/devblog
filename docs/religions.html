      <p>By the condition of creating Love, I understand the purpose of any Book. They all have something to teach, about reality, about our self's. By logic, you can love living beings or objects, if is your choice to try to make that object "better", that was originally, since Love is only dedication and being able to "exclude what you want for yourself, by the desire to see someone else, better, which include to Teach and inform, nothing more, without any punishment desire as a behavior of those who wish to be in control of everything, without the ability to deal with errors and unexpected feedbacks" </p>
      <p>Loving a Book, creates the need to see in reality what the book describe. Daoism Books can be a bit "superficial", if you have a child in your mind, which is not bad, since we all need to learn and in that process, a <a href="./theTransformation.html">transformation</a> of the self happen, becoming something else, without changing the self. </p>
      <p>In Daoism readings, the Unexpected and Unpredictability of Life is what we can Expect, while many other Books, they only expect what they define that should be expected and with it, create mechanisms of exclusion, rejection and revange in the condition of dealing with the unexpectable. </p>
      <p>Like all software or operating systems in the world, they all can be updated in a "compulsive and rational" way, to become better, and they will continue like that, for all eternity, so if you think, all could try to create better religion, with more conscience about human fragilities, but in some many centuries that desire was not in humanity, but their choice was to be "stop in time", without feeling the need to update or upgrade, everything they are. There are many books that are based and inspired by other books, creating a "continuity" of how the first book could be different, creating something new, which is natural because is Organic, like we all are, like we all shall be for eternity.</p>
      <p>Well, now that we have robots we can exterminate human kind and see robots living in peace for eternity. If You Wish!</p>
      <p>Maybe the ability to think was not in the main intention, but only (control). In that case, the lesson is that you had the desire to become God and naturally fail, since God don't control anything, if not only, being a "guide" in your own mind, when to make your choices. </p>
      <p>The Non-Believers are thankful to "what they cannot control", which can be the definition of God, while they don't Love God, since you can only Love living beings, since that is your lesson and dutty to be in reality, that is the objective of your soul and therefor, to be able to love God, you need to focus on your choices in reality, nothing more, which what non-believers normally do, even if the condition of believing is not mandatory to God, but each one choice in reality (only). </p>
      <p>White my choice was to create something, and to try to teach about <a href="./simplicity.html">simplicity</a>, I don't feel any desire to punish those who deny my will. </p>
