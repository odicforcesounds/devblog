      <p>Since I can use Mastodon from the Terminal, I really like this social network, but here is how much Stupidity this servers use:</p>
    <p>If I am blocked by someone, what should happen is that the person who block me, would not see my posts again (which is fair), but what happen is that I got a limitation of using this platform without knowing the reasons for that decision (which is unfair). So, I can block anyone and that person will be limit to use this application, without knowing the reasons of their own instance server apply to them this limitations.</p>
      <p>I am not Surprised. The Justice systems have always been <a href="./unfairLearning.html">unfair</a> while this servers that "Yell against people that behave unfairly to many (Elon Musk), they do the same they are against" Lol You are a Fucking Joke!!! </p>
      <p>Like the <a href="./stupidPolice.html">Police</a> do, Orders without thinking</p> 
      <p>Like Governments do, <a href="./portugueseStupidLaws.html">Laws</a> without thinking</p>
      <p>You should think about what you are doing, don't you think?</p>
      <p>Maybe you cannot, but that is another Historical problems in Human History.</p>
      <p>Is like arresting innocent people for no reason.</p>
      <p>Criminal Justice is what You!</p>
      <p>I can limit anyone usage on this platform, and they will never know the reasons for that decision. </p>
      <p>At least Elon Musk explain his own reason, and even if they are stupid, at least we know the reasons for that decision. (fair)</p>
