      <p>In case I wish to use this OS as a Firewall, I should try to use it, without installing any extra software, to be sure that my "Router" is secure. But, by reading OpenBSD documentation, I see that is possible to use this OS as a Desktop with Firefox, and many other software that I normally use when using Linux. In fact, I can even emulate a Linux box inside OBSD and run the applications that I like to run that are not in OBSD, to access them with easy. The popularity of this OS is not big, while I am not searching for popularity, but for stability. By default, if you try to use Firefox the system will be damn slow and You may ask: "But why?". The answer is on the default configurations that OBSD runs on. If you change it, you will have a "fast OS" without being damn slow. Is less secure? ( probably is, but if you are not serving any public service, is not a big deal to change those configurations ). So, I start trying to use 'vi' without install 'vim'. Is a bit strange, since there a few changes, but if you know how to play with Vim, then 'vi' will be a bit different but not so much. There is no default browser, therefor, I need to install a minimal package, like 'w3m' or 'elinks', which are my favorite browsers for the terminal. With this in mind, I can configure a machine to be a dedicated firewall, while having others that are not, but Desktops. Sadly, at least for me, I need to have a dedicated machine using Linux, since the Cloudflared application to create a tunnel between my personal server and Cloudflare servers, don't run on OBSD or in FBSD. At that point, I will keep the most accessible Linux OS in the world, which is (in my opinion, Debian). I can run it inside a VM or in a dedicated Machine. For this, I really prefer to dedicate a Machine for this, since I can run all the necessary software, without hacking the system to make it work. When using a Tunnel, all traffic is managed by the service we are using, not by OBSD. The fascinating fact is that, we don't need to open Extra ports to accept connections from the outside world, and we can validate all http requests using Cloudflare API, to be sure that all connections we accept, are from a trusted source. The <a href="./whoTheyAre.html">developers</a> are integrated with awesome projects, that are independent from OBSD main OS. These <a href="./openbsdDevelopers.html">people</a> care to create a stable and secure OS and with that in mind, I feel <a href="./openSecurity.html">safe</a>. I start to read about the default shell they use, which is the <b>Korn Shell</b>, which anyone can find some documentation in the <b>IBM</b> site, while there is another community called <b>SpaceWorks</b> that is a Awesome source of Information and a very nice platform to clear our doubts. In this research on "how to use OBSD" without installing (too much extra software), I am learning a bit more about OBSD flow. For example, I really like to know the difference betweeen folder and files, which I didn't find how to setup colors of the listed files, I can use the (alias ls='ls -F') in the .profile and with that, I can see if the listed files are files or folders. It would be the same if using 'ls -p'. Anyway, I always like to have this sensation that I am upgrading everything I know, with something that give me a new sensation of stability and security. Nothing is unbreakable and nothing is eternal, but this project is made by many users that are very experienced with C, C++, Rust, Go, Python, Perl and many others languages that may be useful to use in any OS. I am still in doubt about what is best (between pure <a href="./nativeVMMs.html">VMMs</a>or Qemu). Because Qemu have better suport for Graphics, using Qemu can have some advanges, even if the main objective is to use a Linux without X. I will continue testing while learning.</p>
