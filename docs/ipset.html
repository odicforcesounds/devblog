<p>Managing a server, will be a awesome experience for me, since I
always pay attention to <strong>Security</strong>, while have no
intentions to use most Offensive tools, I really love to use the
Defensive Tools. Therefor, is good to block, not all, but some, which <a
href="./crazyLife.md">Fail2Ban</a> can help. The Internet is awesome,
and we always find someone else with the same problem or with some
solution. Geolocation Lookup service in our servers, is a good approach
to understand about the attackers, but I donâ€™t wish to understand them
and therefor, a permenent Ban is the best choice.</p>
