# Monkey Blog, Monkey Thoughts

Imagination(**Knowledge**) + Logic(**Rationality**) = Application(**Philosophy**)

Which means: 1 + 1 = 1 OR 3 道 (Dao/Tao)

The **Dao** is the Path, and the Path is simple.

Then we have the [Tao](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Tao/index.html), which is the condition. 
The condition is not always easy, but by the illusion to archive it, is possible.

Our ability to imagine is based on what we know. 
That is how we create new ideas, positive or false, but possible to create them in reality, as a image, text or static object, while this days, objects can move and even talk, with A.I. 
What ever is the Logic Path we select, we will create an expression with that, which is the [Application](https://wiki.odicforcesounds.com). 

Old knowledge that make sense to me, while the principles of creation, being part of what we can imagine, is based on the concept of **Maya** from Hinduism, and is in fact as well, part of how Zen Schools select their students. The selection is based on what they can imagine, sharing all their capacities to interpret the world. This is one of the main reasons I love Asian cultures. The definition of what each can imagine, is not given by the author as something concrete and objective, but something that doesn't depend on the author, but in the ability of the reader, to imagine. This describe what we can see in any community around the globe. 

## Monkey notes about domain statistics: July 2025

Last year, the number of visits of the main sub-domain [Art](https://art.odicforcesounds.com) grow, and for the first time I could rich **Hong Kong**, which in the aspect of how many visits I get per month, the number is bigger then **USA**. 

![Statistics](./images/website_stats_2025_july.png)

I feel good to see this results, just because I believe that **Chinese** will agree about my interpretation of the 道, which I describe as [The Style of God](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Dao/index.html), which is all about, what we do, what we create, what we become. I become a Monkey and I do a lot of reading and writing, even if sometimes I talk alone. ;) 

**Ireland** is as well a country that "visit a lot" this website. I think there is a **Myth** about **Dragons** in old Ireland cultures. I don't know why, but there are a lot of cultures that like **Dragons**, even **Japan** and many others. 

**Note**: I notice about melicious **Ireland** activity, that is trying to hack my sites. Maybe you already know that I use **Cloudflare** to manage **DNS** and other **HTTP** inputs, so I redirect them to [this](https://blog.odicforcesounds.com/blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/ABBT.html) page, to motivate them to learn more. You know, they use some automatic **Script-Kid** Tool to hack **Wordpress** / **PHP** frameworks. I don't know why, but I don't like **PHP**. I Like [HTML](./blog/web/html.md) and [CSS](./blog/web/css.md). [JavaScript](./blog/web/javascript.md) can be useful and [NodeJS](./blog/web/nodejs.md) can be useful too. Well, in fact this specific sub-domain is made with **Markdown** only and hosted in **GitHub**.

## Application Development

Always looking for [someone](https://book.odicforcesounds.com) help, to [play](https://play.odicforcesounds.com) with me this game, I am about to build. 

I am starting to invest my time and money, trying to build the application, described in the audio-track [Social Tool Kit](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Dao/login/index.html), from the album **Emotional Signals** as a Android application. If you click the last link, then you can see the final objective of this application, which describe a Challenge for all kind of groups, from public to private, industry, governments, ET's :D (World Wide). 

In the **Spiritual Algorithmic** album, there is another audio-track, with a description of this application, with the name [The Challenge](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Spiritual_Algorithmic/tracks/01_The_Challenge/index.html), where another tracks like **Mr. JSON**, **Data - Objects and Functions**, **Into the World of JavaScript**, **Firebase - Solar Plexus**, already point to the direction of what this application need to use. Firebase structure is like JSON, and since in all kind of databases, deal with data, objects and functions exist by that condition. It looks very connected, very obvious. 

Naturally, this application can be useful for all communities in the world, since is a way to define a "objective" that is "subjective", while being part of what each can see, and each sensibility, focused in a intention to care, and show others those acts of care. For children and older. ;) 

## Thinking Linux 

Me as a [Linux user](./blog/index.md) I always like to understand how servers work and what I need to do to configure a server, while my internet usage is lower, since I am a big fan of [RSS](./blog/newsboat/urls) protocol, which give me the opportunity to read almost everything without using a [web browser](./blog/linux/w3m.md). Most of the time the activity of my computers, are using [Tmux](./blog/linux/tmux.md), [Mutt](./blog/linux/mutt.md), [Irssi](./blog/linux/irssi.md), [Calcurse](./blog/linux/calcurse.md), [Git](./blog/linux/git.md), [Tut](./blog/linux/tut.md), [NVM](./blog/linux/nvm.md) to install NodeJS as a user, [Pandoc](./blog/linux/pandoc.md) to convert Markdown files to HTML, [Vim](./blog/linux/vim.md) that become my daily editor, some [Rust](./blog/linux/rust.md) useful projects, and some others, using [Python](./blog/linux/python.md). I rarely login in platforms, I rarely use social-networks. I even use another awesome application called [NChat](https://github.com/d99kris/nchat) to run inside **Tmux**. [WPA-Supplicant](./blog/linux/wpa_supplicant.md) if I need to use some public Wifi, which is very rare to happen, the amazing [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) using [FFMPEG](./blog/linux/ffmpeg.md) to convert videos on audios. 

Having a dedicated server is another topic, while Cloudflare offer the [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) application, to create a tunnel between their servers and my private webserver. This can be a [awesome](./blog/awesome/README.md) way to at least, own the data and own the server for only, Electricity cost + Internet cost. Then I start to investigate, what I need to have a [secure](./blog/linux/permissions.md) host, beside the Firewall features that Cloudflare already offer for free, to registered users who own a domain, and naturally, to all developers.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) can be a good approach, while I always like the old fashion of a [Nginx](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker) server or [Apache](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker). A [Self Hosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) application is awesome, while having the server outside home and have the Admin-Panel running at home, by my will, is another good approach. Then the server have no Login-Form on Internet, and therefor, the attack surfice is lower.

 I find amazing projects at GitHub with all kind. [Fail2Ban](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Fail2Ban-Blacklist-JAIL-for-Repeat-Offenders-with-Perma-Extended-Banning) is a known software for servers, to block what they call "offenders", which is malicious activity from random users using automatic scripts, or people who know more about how to think, can find [bugs](./blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/ABBT.md) in the code, to be able to hack the code, while my side needs to think about the other side of the attack, which is focused on [Security](./blog/awesome/files/Security/Defensive/ASH.md) techniques to prevent all kind of [Security](./blog/awesome/files/Security/Defensive/ATDH.md) issues. 

In this investigation I found that even **Google** do some [SPAM](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Stop.Google.Analytics.Ghost.Spam.HOWTO) and there is a [Phishing Database](https://github.com/Phishing-Database/Phishing.Database). O_o

I personally use in my Linux computers, the [StevenBlack](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts) hosts or for a **paranoid** situation the [Ultimate-Host-Blacklist](https://github.com/Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist/Ultimate.Hosts.Blacklist), which are projects that are regulary updated. 

My web surf is cleaner and I feel better.
