# My Blog, my thoughts 

## Monkey notes about domain statistics

Last year, the number of visits of odicforcesounds.com grow, and for the first time I could rich Hong Kong, which in the aspect of, how many visits I get per day/month, are bigger then USA. 

I feel good to see this results, just because I believe that Chinese will agree about my interpretation of the ÈÅì, which I describe as [The Style of God](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Dao/index.html), which is, what we do, what we create, what we become. I become a Monkey. 

Ireland is as well a country that "visit a lot" this website. 

*Note*: I notice that some Ireland activity is trying to hack my sites. Maybe you already notice that I use Cloudflare to manage DNS and other HTTP inputs, so I redirect them to this page so they can learn more. You know, they use some ScriptKid Tools to hack Wordpress / PHP frameworks. I don't know why, but I don't like PHP. I Like HTML and CSS. JavaScript can be useful and NodeJS can be useful too. Well, in fact this specific sub-domain is made with Markdown only and hosted in GitHub.

I am starting to invest my time, trying to build the application, described in the audio-track **Social Tool Kit - World Wide Conscience Cleaner**, from the album [Emotional Signals](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/index.html) as a Android application.

In my dreams, which could be possible to archived fast with [someone](https://book.odicforcesounds.com) help, maybe will be just impossible, but I will keep trying to build it. 

In the **Spiritual Algorithmic** album, there is another audio-track, with a description of this application, with the name [The Challenge](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Spiritual_Algorithmic/tracks/01_The_Challenge/index.html), where another tracks like **Mr. JSON**, **Data - Objects and Functions**, **Into the World of JavaScript**, **Firebase - Solar Plexus**, already point to the direction of what this application need to use. 

Naturally, this application can be useful for all communities in the world.

Having a dedicated server is another topic, while Cloudflare offer the [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) application, to create a tunnel between their servers and my private webserver. This can be a [awesome](./blog/awesome/README.md) way to at least, own the data and own the server for only, Electricity cost + Internet cost. Then I start to investigate, what I need to have a [secure](./distros/security.md) host, beside the Firewall features that Cloudflare already offer for free, to registered users who own a domain, and naturally, to all developers. 

[Docker](./blog/linux/Docker) can be a good approach, while I always like the old fashion of a [Nginx](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker) server or [Apache](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker). A [Self Hosted](./blog/linux/selfhosted.md) application is awesome, while having the server outside home and have the Admin-Panel running at home, by my will, is another good approach. Then the server have no Login-Form on Internet, and therefor, the attack survace is lower.  

Me as a [Linux user](./blog/index.md) I always like to understand how servers work and what I need to do to configure a server. I find amazing projects at GitHub with all kind. [Fail2Ban](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Fail2Ban-Blacklist-JAIL-for-Repeat-Offenders-with-Perma-Extended-Banning) is a known software for servers, to block what they call "offender", which is malicious activity from random users using automatic scripts, or people who know more about how to think, can find [bugs](./blog/awesome/files/Security/Offensive/ABBT.md) in the code, to be able to hack the code. 

In this investigation I found that even Google do some [SPAM](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Stop.Google.Analytics.Ghost.Spam.HOWTO) and there is a [Phishing Database](https://github.com/Phishing-Database/Phishing.Database). O_o I personally use my Linux computers, the [StevenBlack](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts) hosts or for a **paranoid** situation the [Ultimate-Host-Blacklist](https://github.com/Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist/Ultimate.Hosts.Blacklist), which are projects that are regulary updated. My web surf is cleaner and I feel better.
