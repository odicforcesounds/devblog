      <!--       BODY -->
      <p>Dreams, are for all eternity, possibilities that can become real. The dreamer need to work hard, to create that possibility in reality. Not everything depends on dreamer work, since all business are somehow, dreams that wish to become real, being they just services or offering products, that others may wish to own a copy of it. Like all commercial services and products, they try to add something new, something original, but we know that they all come from the same source.</p>
      <p>For example, Computers and Robots were described as possible in books, before any computer exist in reality. To build that dream, within the <b>core</b> of <b>imagination</b>, the only way to create it, was based on <b>obvious</b> knowledge, based on <b>logic</b> patterns of what most real we have in this world, which is physics. Todays we can "fight against natural laws", while by logic, there is not such thing as <i>Fighting against</i>, but <i>Flow in Between</i> to create that possibility without spending too much energy to <b>"fight"</b> against something that is invinsible.</p>
      <p>I think Science proof in all discoveries or inventions, is that specific detail that was mention. <b>No Fight againt</b>, but <b>Flow in between</b>. We cannot fight against the Sea, but we can flow within, in between. We cannot fight against the Wind, but we can flow within, in between. We cannot fight others perspectives or interpretations, but we can flow in between, which is what Education aims to be. A function of transformation that is present to point others, to better directions.</p>
      <p>Question: What flows between, is part of it?</p>
      <p>Answer: If we need to describe the <b>flow</b> in Time, when the <b>flow</b> is <i>running</i> and is <i>integrated</i>, we could think that the <b>flow</b> is part of, wherever the flow is flowing in between. I mean, Birds fly. They are not part of the air, but they flow within and between the air. So in that precise moment of time, when we see a bird flying in the sky, the bird is part of the sky, even not being by it's nature. </p>
      <p>For each fragment of what computers give us this days, there was a dreamer that did dream about a possibility. Some of them, work all their life to create the dream in reality. Dreamers always had <b>Hard Times</b>, and all those who didn't embrace that quality of Time, which is, spending time to create something, <i>fighting against</i> those who are trying to build their dream, are not able to spend time to create their dream.</p>
      <p>The exercises of abstraction and critical thinking is always good, even if we point them to persons. The trick is to understand that, persons create by it's natural condition, a comparative mental-function, to validate some information, since is all living beings logic function, which permite the identification of something we can "see", within our ability to imagine. You cannot fight against imagination. You cannot fight against creativity. You cannot fight against Art, since Art is the product of our History.</p>
      <p>In (this moment in time) of my "political" perspective, the <b>right hand</b> (<i>Yin</i>) is always seeing the best in the self, which is tricky, since that "light" (which represent the best) is part of their past, blocking the progressive ideas and transformation, while the <b>left hand</b> (<i>Yang</i>), is always open to evolution and progress, trying the best they can, to <b>flow between</b> the <i>"problems"</i> that need to deal with. Yin will reject to deal with the problem if Yang, fails to "fix it". Yin will fight against those who <b>deny</b>, which is "stupid", since the "light" can move in the "dark", by "walking", to create transformation within it's own movement, but if the focus is not on all others, is not seen as positive, like Yang is, because the "light" is projected to "all others", creating transformation, in others who are able to Imagine, from what was expressed as a possibility, which can inspire other creations.</p>
      <p>Maybe is the "origins" of everything we are: "dreams expressed" that inspired us to become what we are.</p>
      <p>Lets assume we are all invinsible, even if by nature, we are not, by learning to dance in between the world of imagination, source of humanity creations and all irregular natural expressions of Earth. </p>
