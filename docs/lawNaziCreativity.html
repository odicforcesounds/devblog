      <p>Hopefully you are Nazi and Your deeper desire is to die soon. I am greateful for your intelligent decision. I really think is the best choice you ever made in History. I don't know if you know, but all symbols that Nazis use, are "stolen" from the cultures that they discriminate. (just another funny and <a href="./drugsSalvation.html">contradictory</a> fact) from <a href="./theGoodOnChristianity.html">History</a> that make this experience even more funny.</p>
      <p class="center">Since you are more or less equal to a <a href="./youAreSoWeek.html">Dog</a> sucking his own cock, my wishes is that you suck it all. </p>
      <p>Symbology used by the Nazis are from Buddhism, while Judeism use one of them (which is the Kaballah), that is older than Judeism it self. Another implementation that the Nazis made was extracted from Hinduism (The Castas), which is a Eternal Discriminatory Social System, that gladly India reject the system few years ago. (at least after more than 40 centuries discrimination people by Economic classes)</p>
      <p>Some details that are interesting in my experience of life and by reading history, about the Muslin. Like the Nazis, they believe that War is the unique way to do anything, while not all believe on that (gladly) the majority does. But You know when the Muslin conquer Spain? They didn't impose the Military service to the Christians and they didn't add a condition of (changing religion), like the Christianity did against many, imposing them to serve the Military, even if they were against. (+1 for the Muslin) in that respectul approach that demonstrate respect from someone that is not equal (is not Muslin is Christian). </p>
      <p>If you read the AlQuran and you think about the Time that these texts were written, you may think that some of the inspiration of AlQuran is in fact Christianity Activity (in their desire to conquer the world by killing those who refuse God or Jesus), some of the "Rules" that AlQuran apply was some of the (punishments) that Christianity was using... Constantine Conquer the Church 4 Centuries after Christ with a "Vision" of victory, and the Church only ask Contantine to become Christian. After that conversion, Constantine had Total Freedom to kill in the name of the Church. (a very prostitute church), while any prostitute is better than the Church. </p>
