      <p>This article aims to be somehow the <a href="./EthicalLawsOnIT.html">continuity</a> of this one, that speak about common mistakes made by the Justice system. The American one, since the Asian one, did not accept to legalize Guns and Sell them to anyone, without the need to use one. In America, Guns are legal objects that anyone can buy, and the result of it, is people killing others for no reason, while if there is some reason, is a superficial reason. Commerciants did some criminal activity when someone take from them, what they are selling, like the drug dealers do, when someone refuse to pay. In the above article, I try to explain the condition that America already try to solve, which was Guns traffic. <br> 
      They control it (lets say), because they legalize it and therefor, the sellers didn't become criminals, because they are in a legal position. So, a Guns seller can use guns, but it doesn't mean they will use it, even IF the Law say they can. So, here is the super Contradiction of these laws: You can but you cannot. You can use guns, but if you use them, you will be arrested. Is like saying to someone that, they can eat some food that is on the table, but if they eat the food that is on the table, they can be arrested. Naturally we can think that, this contractory law was something that was made, to limit the activity that the Law it self, already give permissions to. The same for the <a href="./stupidPolice.html">Police</a>. They can use but if they use, will have problems with justice, and that make sense, while it doesn't. Is like a way to say: "you are free to murder someone, and for that, I give you access to any gun in the world you may wish to own, but if you use it, I am not the <a href="./tryingToFixJustice.html">guity</a> of your actions, even if your actions use the tools that I gave you permission to use. </p>
      <p>LoL ---> At least in this aspect, America could legalize Drugs commercialization, and prohibid Drugs consume: It would be another contradictory decision, in the middle of many others they have, but at least they don't need to bomb people that are in boats, while if they kill them when they keep being alive, is because who is doing this approach is the military, that have a compulsive historical need to kill inocents, Woman, Children and all other living beings ( for fun ( since the murdering of this people was not the main <a href="./inTheNameOfJustice.html">target</a> of their "professional" activity )). </p>
      <p>So, I feel like I need to copy American Laws: You can READ this article, but if You read it, I can punish you for reading ! :D </p>
