      <p>Setup a machine in bridge mode in your ISP router. Start monitoring that interface using TCPDump for example and see how many attempts you will get each minute. There are so many that I am sure, that this bots and scanners, can find something useful to exploit, every single day. Right now, I test this with OpenBSD, and since I am sharing a service using a Tunnel, I don't need to open extra ports to serve this service. I will not tell you anything about it, since this way I can prevent a few more attacks against me. I feel that I add all information in websites about "how anyone can contact me" or "how anyway can send me a message", but people just attack without saying anything at all. In any case, maybe some of this attacks are not focusing my sites but many other sites, while is true that many attacks use "wordpress" Paths, which let me think that attackers don't read the code that is accessible from the Browser. With this level of stupidity I always make fun of them. But yeah, the internet is a world full of attacks attempts. If you open a single door in this machine, you will see. If you don't open any port, you see the same. So, at the end of this experience, I finally decide to serve some services on my home, using tunnels. When I scan my own ISP router I see some open ports. This guys open Window$ services protocols, which is stupid in the aspect of, this configurations are setup by default. I am not a guy that wish to spend time judging others choices or trying to earn some money from the curt, but I think I could do that. Maybe one day, when I get bored with my own things, I will start doing it, until ISPs change their security or until they all disapear. :) That would be crazy, because I will lose Internet services, like everyone else, while that would create a positive and social condition for many. Sometimes I am using Mastodon to share this publications. The number of Bots that try to crawl my sites in the next second is so big, that I feel that I am having a lot of visits, but that is not true at all. Number of visits on my sites per month is less than 10.000 persons. My objective is to have 10.000.000.000.000 per second :))) If that happen, visitors would be banned. :))  </p>
