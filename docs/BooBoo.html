      <p>I see that many, pay too much attention to the Big Companies, while paying attention to them, make them grow and become stronger and stronger, just by the condition of having more and more people paying attention to what these "Big Companies" declare to the public as something necessary or as the main objective.</p>
      <p>By the Logical condition of <a href="./style_of_god.html">Life</a>, anyone who wish to produce something in reality, need to focus their mind into the objective, which at that stage is pure "illusion", while if each use Logic to archive the possibility of what that illusion aims to archive, anyone can create their personal illusion as a product in reality. Anyway, the main lesson of everything we know, from so many centuries of human development, is that the logical path can be produced faster, when many are paying attention to it. If many focus in Religion Book, they will produce what books describe in reality. If many focus in Marcial Arts, the development of new techniques grow faster. If many (as it is in actual days) focus in Technology development, IT development grows faster. If many pay attention to what some individual express to all others, the probability to create the perfect condition to make possible the creation of a single individual, become more close to be possible. It is like this, it was like this and it will be like this, for All Eternity.</p>
      <p>I read about some crazy plans about the future, and with that, what looks a bit insane, become the main objective and with that, the creation of those conditions in reality. So, I should remember you a small detail that you can test anywhere. Imagine that you are in the streets and some guy start yelling against everyone, that they are all being manipulated by some "misterious living beings". If many stop and start paying attention to what this man is declaring loudly, even if everything that this person declare is a Lie, the Lie become a possible truth, since the condition of attention is made by many. If you and everyone else ignore what this person is yelling, he will quit from everything he wish to produce, from all these crazy ideas and life continue as it should. </p>
      <p>If after all these last centuries you didn't learn how to deal with what it's absurd, then you are repeating the old mistakes, while you should fix the problem and upgrade.</p>
      <p>Without that ability to create new perspectives and new approachs, the probability is to go back to some "secure" state of conscience, that can be damn old, which would result in the notion of losing several centuries of evolution.</p>
      <p>A awesome comparative example is on Operating Systems. Imagine that you use the Classic Windows98. If you deny to upgrade, your system becomes obsolete and after a few years, nothing work with it. Since you refuse to update and upgrade, the best choice you have to continue, is to use pens and papers again as the unique possible solution to adapt yourself to the evolution. <br> <br>  I am not sure if You have a big desire to use the Abaco to solve Math and Logic problems, but you can use it without downgrading the system. This event happen several times in History. The Stupid "thing", is that history describe that, but people just memorize it without thinking about what they memorize, which will result in "I didn't learn anything, but I copy everything".</p>
      <p class="center">That is sad and can make people mad</p>
