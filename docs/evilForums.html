      <p>But this <a target="_blank" href="https://daemonforums.org">BSD community</a> make it difficult to me.</p>
      <p>As I said in some old article of this blog, I am a huge fan of RSS. I can read the news without living the terminal, since I am using <b>Newsboat</b> application to read them all. I really <b>LOVE</b> when RSS feeds share the full content of their articles. I really <b>hate</b> when they just share a link to the article,  but I can understand, since for the website administrator, having visits into the website, is what most excitment event, that they can have, even if, I use <code>w3m</code> to open the sites, and I could use <code>curl</code> to extract the content. I don't need to be connected all the time, just to read a "text file".  Anyway, the Daemons of this BSD community make it difficult to me and for that, I see them as being Evil. </p>
      <p>In the same old article I make reference above, I say I am not a fan of PHP, for no logic reasons is true, but this can be a big reason to that result. </p>
      <p>All their RSS links are in PHP format, while RSS uses XML format. I don't know how to convert feed.php links into xml, but since I cannot make that conversion in a easy way, without asking Newsboat author to implement that feature or by developing one by myself, I declare that the <b>Daemon Forums</b> are Evil. :) </p>
      <p>I thought that I could find some awesome resources in this forum, like I can find in the FreeBSD forum, but since I cannot add them into my favorite Internet Protocol, I have something to say "bad" about them. LoL Is this human quality that most people like. To describe someone as being "good" or "bad" based on what each want for him/her self. And that is the fact of the obvious result we have in reality. The chaos of billions of "personal wills" and "personal perspectives" and "personal interpretations", of the same subject.</p>
      <p>That is the <a href="./style_of_god.html">Lesson</a> that we should learn, but looks difficult to archive it.</p>
      <p>While we must admite: Those who are able to build something new within the chaotic interpretation of anything, are the ones who are more connected to one single aspect of human kind. The <b>Will</b> of creating what is in our minds, is always possible, using <b>logic</b>, an instrument of <b>knowledge</b>, to be able to create what at first exist only in the mind. So try to not spend <b>Your Time</b> fighting against what could do the same you can. Take your time to create what is in your mind.</p>
