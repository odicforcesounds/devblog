      <p>As described in the article <a href="./blockingMyEvilCreativity.html">My Evil Creativity</a>, people around the world, ones more than anothers, don't like to work using the brain and therefor they prefere to become animals, that demonstrate having no control of the self and create using violence, what they desire to accomplish, which is not a good choice for civilians or society.</p>
      <p>In the article <a href="./style_of_god.html">The Style of God</a> I describe more or less the same, with all the common examples from history about how humanity is NOT following what is described in their Sacred Book, using the Brain, because if they read and question about what they are reading, maybe they understand the meanings, but if they read it as a manual of instructions, then they will be unfair to many.</p>
      <p>Sometimes people talk about these <a href="./commonAsia.html">common</a> examples from history, as the <a href="./criminalMasters.html">Highers of Society</a> who control society, but I don't see it like that. The Military education can be part of the problem, mainly when the "user" have no desire to participate, because is part of how <a href="./theGoodOnChristianity.html">Christianity</a> process education for many centuries, resulting in a Agressive and Violent society that is not what their <a href="./ChristianLinux.html">Loved one</a> Wish to see from them, while having more gold, houses and everything else in a exagerated way, is what they build for them selfs.</p>
      <p>Maybe they fall in Love with the Idea of the Devil, in that perspective of having a lot power, but the "Devil" is only one that cannot be cruxified like Jesus Christ was. In the perspective of the "Devil" being a real living being, else is only part of thoughts, which include desires and everything that Jesus Christ refuse to have for him.</p>
      <p>If you read other books, most of them try to offer more or less the same values, while the lovers of those books, are unable to extract the meaning and judge the description by putting in cause with a critical mind set. Therefor, for believers "God" wrote those texts, and they read them like instructions that they need to follow. O_o (why the heck you when to school anyway?)</p>
      <p>To learn how to Think and Interpret texts, is something that believers don't always make use. But like all disciplines that push students too hard, students can refuse to follow the instructions of their sacred books, because it feels it is full, because to "educate the monster", you need to give time to the monster to read and understand what the monsters is reading. (we are not computers) We are Better! </p>
      <p>Anyway, masturbations can save lifes, because raping any child, it is a sentence to that child for all his life, creating social problems and many other problems like the most common and hidden in society, which is that, those who were raped (mainly man) can feel the desire to rape others (because that experience is in Memory), and what is in Memory is something very difficult to  treat, in case you don't wish to give the exprience where the "user", find someone that is and is not at the same time, what those memories bring to this person his personal choice. For this case, you would need to find a woman that look like a child and the person that wish someone that looks like a child, need to see that child in that woman. You solve a problem easly. </p>
