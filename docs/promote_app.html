<h1 class="title1">Because the value is in the
Self</h1>
<p>Not in somewhere else.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.odicforcesounds.com">This</a> description of
the “Challenge” that target all groups ( public or private ) to join, is
based on 3 main types of actions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create Challenge to Help Nature:
<ul>
<li>Cleaning</li>
<li>Giving water</li>
<li>Teachments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create Challenge to Help Animals:
<ul>
<li>Walk the Dog</li>
<li>Free arrested animals in Bad conditions</li>
<li>Feed animals</li>
<li>Give them a better life</li>
<li>Inform</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create Challenge to Help Persons:
<ul>
<li>Give food</li>
<li>Give clouths</li>
<li>Inform</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Groups are the ones who can solve “challenges”. All users can create
challenges.</p>
<p>All challenges are rated by all users, adding value to the challenge,
+1 per user rate.</p>
<p>All users will have a QR-code, that identify them.</p>
<p>All users will have a list of “contexts”/“characteristics”/+1/-1 that
can be rated by others.</p>
<p>Context is the key, since we can have different choices and behaviors
in different contexts, which means, we can have different quality
characteristics, in different context. A person can have a “fast answer”
in that context, while in another, not, since it depends on subjects as
well.</p>
<p>Is a way to see the value on the self, based on what other self can
see on us, so we can understand the self, better.</p>
<p>The final objective would be to associate a “blockchain” to this
“personal characteristics” each have.</p>
<p>Is like “injecting” more possibilities in Economy, since Economy
depend of the value of each.</p>
