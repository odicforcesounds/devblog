      <p>I don't if you know Portugal, but people in Portugal can live  "perfect" life style, by taking a drink in some random coffee, and pass all day drinking and eating, while in the end of the day, you didn't spend so much money, if you compare the same within many other contries in the world.</p>
      <p>Anyway, Weed and Haxixe in Portugal is "Discriminalized", which means, that anyone can smoke weed or haxixe in the street and the Police will not do anything against you. But the Contradiction of Portuguese Laws on this subject is that, you cannot Sell, you cannot grow your own Hemp Plant and you cannot buy Week or Hexixe, because selling is forbidden. </p>
      <p>Then, by Logic you may ask: "But how can someone smoke something that is forbidden to buy?" By logic that is impossible and that is the reason that we should laught about who implement this law. For example in California (USA), people can grow their own Hemp plants and with that, they don't need to buy to anyone, resulting in a condition, where traffic cannot sell what anyone can have for free, like in Spain, people can grow their own plants and traffic disapear by that condition, where what they are selling, is what everyone can have for Free and therefor, traffic for that specific material disapear. </p>
      <p>While Spain allow someone to grow their own dedicated plant (or many) to consume, in California (they cannot), which is a bit stupid, since that would be the condition to stop traffic without fighting against, even if the quality of Weed in America is FALSE and artificial, which result in being <a href="./poison.html">POISON</a> for civilians, like the Offical Tabaco is, if you compare to Pure tabaco. Since it is in America, I open a space in my mind to understand their stupidity in that aspect, since for the majority of Americans, the most important objective is to make money. So, by the principle of making more money, like all Drug dealers do, they mix stuff that shouldn't be there, and sometimes is real poison, to make more money. </p>
      <p>Anyway, in Holand there are some specific shops (coffeeShops) to people buy and smoke weed, since is forbidden to smoke on the streets, but at least is not forbidden or to buy or to smoke, if people go into the buildings that are made with that objective. (in that aspect, I cannot laught against Netherlands Laws), because they are Rational and Logic. Not the same for USA or Portugal. </p>
