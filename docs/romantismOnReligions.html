      <p> <a href="./religions.html">Religions</a> always had a Romantic perspective for the Community. Is important to me, to explicitly split these two ideas. One thing is the Institution(Church) and another is the community that Follow the Institution. Even if I believe that the Followers of any <a href="./theGoodOnChristianity.html">Religion</a> should Questions and be able to Deny what the Institution believe and Practice, I make a difference, ebcause when celebrating their lifes, they celebrate for their families, not in the name of the Institution they follow.</p>
      <p>We are getting close to that Date where <a href="./historicalEvent.html">Christian</a> families get together and celebrate the union of the family living in peace. Even if not all families are in peace with each others, in Christmas they try to be together without fighting each others. It is a very cool exercise that they should do in all other days to be able to be more close to what Jesus Christ expect from everyone. Humility to <a href="./stupidPolitics.html">Discuss</a> and think how they can solve the "problem", without fighting. [After 20 Centuries] of Fights that didn't solve the problem.</p>
      <p>People try to help the homeless, there are many things that Christian societies are good, but I always like to remember the bad, because is from the Bad choices we do, that we learn to make better choices. Is like those things that "our" mother/father tell us, to warn us about some danger. It is the bad and it is what possibly already happen as bad and what can happen again, but we know by coding and building projects, that there is no other way to deal with anything.</p>
      <p>The Romantic perspective of helping the one that need is part of most religion groups, while not all practice what their own religions points them to be, that is the main objective. In all history, the unique religion group that point to some kind of solution to deal with people inside business, it was the AlQuran author, that describe that condition should exist, in business, since is know that in Business, most groups can be corrupt and be violent against those who don't pay, like the legal system is against those who don't pay what they should, while not being as criminal as any commercial store can be, when the problem is money and even less criminal than any other criminal group, that didn't find a solution to solve the problem without being violent or letal. </p>
      <p>In any case, all <a href="./religionsSymbolicTime.html">Religions</a> try to announce to everyone, that "Money" should not be more important than Ethics or Morals, but one thing is the Romantic perspective, and other thing is Reality, that show us the final choices of groups. Is like the <a href="./jews.html">Jews</a>. They are trying to find "The One", while "The One" is not Jew, but the condition of expression of what Jews create in reality. You know, to train a <a href="./youAreSoWeek.html">Dog</a> that attacks everyone, you need to be persistent, while in the moment that the Dog doesn't attack anyone anymore, the Trainer become the Expression of that Success to the Dog, but the Trainer is not the Dog. The child went to school and present their parents to "show himself", but his self is not what his parents are, even being his representants. </p>
      <p>Society Spiritual developments try to be fair, but few could. While many of the Abrahamic religions believe that wars can be created by the name of "God", few that are not Abrahamic could grow without creating Wars, to conquer more than what they already have. For example, Buddhism members, only use Weapons when their own freedom was in risk, which condition is equaly described in the <a href="./MuslinLaws.html">AlQuran</a>. Is the Only and Unique Moments in all Book, that the Author points that wars is the unique solution to solve "Their Spiritual and Religious Freedom". Even if this "fight" looks to be fair, we can only assume that it is fair, if is in their territory, like Buddhists did in Tibet, few years ago, where some one them, demonstrate that they prefere to die than to fight, burning them selfs alives, without producing any sound of suffering.</p>
      <p>I can be wrong, but what I believe is that "Heaven" or "Hell" can only exist in Reality. Not after Death, because After Death, even if there is a continuity for our souls, we will not remember anything from this life experience and therefor, by that logic condition, it would be like a new life experience, without knowing anything about the last. I really think that all religions try to create their small "paradise" on Earth, but like always, some others, try to create "hell" to others. </p>
      <p>A lot of Gifts, a lot of Smiles a lot of Goodness for the Majority, all days of the year, and for many others only in that day. For fewer, the <a href="./questionOrders.html">repetition</a> of all errors from history, is what they continue to do.</p>
