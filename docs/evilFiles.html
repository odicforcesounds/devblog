      <p>In the name of Light, history don't Lie. The Light Burn many things, destroy many things and Darkness didn't. Darkness explore the limits of what is unknown and give space to create freedom of choice, while the Light, create limits of choice, removing Freedom to create anything with imagination, in case we are speaking about Art, or speaking about Spirituality, which did result in historical events.</p>
      <p>What is Evil is what we need to ask and how to detect that evilness is another question we may ask. By experience and by example, we see that evil can hide itself by showing the self as something good, while Light show the self as something bad, refusing to hide the self  from all other selfs.</p>
      <p>Maybe it is almost obvious that, some contradictons exist, since the Good  become bad and the Bad become good, only by the way each deal with reality. How much each wish to control reality and by that condition,  how each can destroy others dreams and reality. For example, we an think about the Church of Christianity that by the desire to dominate did kill billions in the name of "Christ", which means, in the name of "Light" (even being in the self, pure darkness, since the loved one is unfairly crucified), like Islamic religion did, against all who deny their desires. Both declare themselfs being at their core, from light, but by time, they create darkness to all others, while what was for them the core of darkness did create light to all others, like the Hindu, Nordic Paganism and others.</p>
      <p>So what is really darkness and how deadly darkness can be to those who deny their will? By history, Darkness did not develop the desire to dominate others and therefor darkness cannot be the symbol of what is bad, while the Light  did develop the desire to dominateothers and therefor, light groups can be the symbol of what is bad on human life. </p>
      <p>Satan is by the source of it's own creation, a Christian figure, but in fact is the one that denies ones desire, which in that case is "God" desire. It is  by that condition that "God" is seen as good, while "Satan" is seen as bad. In fact Satan offer the opportunity to learn based on knowledge and understand reality  based on knowledge, while God, did not offer that opportunity and expect that humanity would be happy to live in ignorance, just by accepting what is around, without the desire to understand. By that condition, God was thinking about Buddhism, since Buddhism desire is to live without understanding deeper, but accepting what it is, by condition, by conscience, while scientific persons cannot live in peace without understanding and without explaining in theory, what is happening around them. </p>
      <p>By the principle of those who deny to burn others freedom in the name of "what is good", Satanism on Art become a way to protest against the abuses made by the Church, like raping children, killing those who deny their will and desire and many other Evil acts that the "Light" did create in Time. But in the middle of what is only a way to protest against those abuses, some did create evil acts in the name of that satanic perspective from those who deny to behave what should be "right". At the present moment, the Epstein files are the example of it. Some minor group create Evil events (like raping and killing children) based on the idea of worship satan, while for centuries, this kind of events happen inside the Church and other groups, but hidden from all others, in form of Shame, since those acts represent the uncontrolled choices that comes from desire. Mainly sexual desire. But worst that a simple desire, they happen because "masturbation" was as well, seen as something wrong. That is the reason that explain how these days, priests declare that raping children is better than masturbation, while at my opinion, 10 masturbations per day, are better than one single rape per life time.</p>
      <p>China declare Death Penalty to those who rape children, but they forgot to think about the reasons behind those acts. Sadly (but not all) the majority of man who try to rape children, were victim of rape when they were children too. This problem come from Memory, since is memory that is the source of what we do as choice. Those who were raped, can feel the desire to do the same to others, like those who were physicly punished for doing something wrong, do use the same technique to force others to learn something. That is the main reason that violent teachments are blocked these days, since the ones that are target of those techniques can do the same, years later against their own children or others. Naturally I agree that Children traffic or human traffic is a Crime, but even if I assume that raping children is a crime too, I think that children (men) that were raped, need to be monitored to ensure they will not repeat the same "error again" against someone, while death penalty would be unfair, by the condition of understanding the psychologic problem behind their choices. The same can happen with Woman, but is more RARE.  </p>
      <p>Does China accept the same rule against them? I mean, if China do some wrong choice, we should Destroy and Kill all chinese people? O_o probably not, but sometimes we need to share these examples in hope that the Chinese Governments read and think twice about what they are doing, while trying to be fair. The probability of same reactions and behaviors from those who were target of those in the past, is bigger than the same behaviors from those who were not target of those behaviors. Paaceful persons rarely become violent, because those who educate them, were not violent against them. ( Logic ) ... while those who were victims of violent teachments, are easly violent against many others. </p>
