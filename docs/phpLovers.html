      <p>I ask <a href="./motivatingAttackers.html">Attackers</a> to be creative, which means, to think about Alternatives, but the <a href="./TopAttackerIPs.html">History</a> of attacks against this site, is always against PHP and all Paths used in those attacks, are the <a href="./againstPatterns.html">Default</a> Paths used in some Frameworks that are based on PHP. So, the attackers are not really creative and they don't even try to improve their own skills. <br><br>  
      I bet that they never Right-Click in any of this sites pages, to select "see Source Code", because they suffer from some Strange Mental Disorder, that unable them to use the Brain or the options that already exist, without using the Brain.</p>
      <p>So how can anyone in the <a href="./wordpress_attacks.html">World</a> can make a site? The answer for the majority of persons is HTML + CSS, while if the reader is an attacker, you will not understand the answer and therefor for You, the only possible answer is PHP. There is no other alternative, no other Possibility. </p>
      <p>Is like asking a child to make a draw of a Dog and they get a picture of a Dog and tell us ( here, is my amazing draw of a Dog ).</p>
      <p>I didn't ask a Perfect Draw, I ask them to be creative, while they refuse to be creative. Sometimes I bet that these persons didn't went to School, and therefor is normal and natural that the first impulsive feedback that comes from them, is rejection against any possible challenge that ask them to use the brain. If <a href="./websitesInformation.html">You</a> know some of this Bad Students, try to motivate them to become better as I do, while You need to understand that they can reject to learn something new, because they are Stupid, while Children are not Stupid, but Ignorant (which is normal at the first years of Life).</p>
