<h1 class="title3">Comparing Linux Distros</h1>
<div class="textbox">
<p>I start using GNU Linux with <a
href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> 7.1, with the first
installation CD. It was a hard time, to have the X server working, but
after almost 1 year exploring and testing, I finaly could. After that, I
start checking others popular distros, just to see the difference
between them. Maybe only BSD systems make me think that something was
really different from each others, but naturally each distro follow some
specification, on how it looks, what packages have already installed,
the different ways to install it, etc.</p>
<p>Years ago, I read the <a
href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/">LFS</a> book and I decide to
test <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>.</p>
<p>Gentoo is the <strong>Best</strong> if we are focusing how much RAM
uses and how this RAM is freeded when applications are terminated. Is
amazing. This is the best feature and result of having a Source-based
GNU Linux distribution like Gentoo. About time consuming in the
compilation process: If you are a person that have more computers to use
and have a life outside of that room full of computers, Gentoo is not so
hard. You start compiling today and tomorow your system may be is ready
to use. If you update your system once per week, the process of waiting
can be less. Naturally there are some packages that ask you a “super
computer” to compile them in less than 24 hours, but you have
alternatives that consume less time of compilation, while Gentoo,
already have a way to install pre-compiled packages like Rust, <a
href="https://www.firefox.com/en-US/?">Firefox</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium">Chromium</a> and others,
that consume a lot of compilation time. Another aspect I like in Gentoo,
is that it uses <a href="https://github.com/OpenRC/openrc">OpenRC</a>,
which Slackware use too, while the majority of distros, change to
Systemd.</p>
<p>Right now, I am testing <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch
Linux</a> that use <a href="https://systemd.io/">Systemd</a> by default
and it consume a little bit more Memory. For example, the minimal
instalation from <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and Arch,
use about 200/300MB without using some extra software. We just login and
we open <a href="https://htop.dev/">HTOP</a> to see how much memory is
using, while we could use the <code>free -h</code> command, just to see
how much memory the OS is using. The same example using
<strong>Gentoo</strong>, we will see the result of the same command,
something like: 70MB. But when we compile software, it will consume a
little bit less than any other pre-compiled software.</p>
<p>Something I didn’t realize for long time, is that Arch have the <a
href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR</a>’s repositories, which enable
us to compile software from the source. And is always a big big
difference. I love to use <a
href="https://github.com/d99kris/nchat">NChat</a>, a terminal
chat-software for Telegram and Whatsapp, and when I compile it it use
about 200MB while when installing from pre-compiled sources, it consume
almost 500MB.</p>
<p>Sadly if a user don’t update Gentoo every month, the user will have a
big big big problem when trying to update, after some months or years.
By this aspect, Gentoo is the <strong>Bad</strong> while Debian is the
<strong>Good</strong>, even if software compatibility is big, Arch Linux
is the <strong>Ugly</strong>.</p>
<p>Gentoo is really nice, if you use the small list of software Gentoo
have. Yes, yes, is small if you compare it to Arch or Debian. I am
really happy to see how Arch include new packages that are not in the
main repositories. One of the package I like to use is <a
href="https://github.com/ammarabouzor/tui-journal">Tui-Journal</a>, a
Rust application or <a
href="https://github.com/Builditluc/wiki-tui">wiki-tui</a>. Both are
already included in the main Arch repositories, while in Debian or
Gentoo, we need to install <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>
to compile this packages.</p>
<p>I fall in Love with Arch. Sadly it use Systemd, but putting away this
little problem, I really love it.</p>
