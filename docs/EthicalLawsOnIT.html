      <p>First of all, Hacking is only a creative process, where the user find new ways to deal with some subject, or object or living being. We can say that the teacher that change the way he explain some subject, did create the necessary understanding for his students, which the teacher only change the sequence of the description, to become more "visual" to the students. This was a Hack. A positive one. The teacher could create a false objective and with that, a false idea of what students should learn. That would create a "bad" hack, even if the technique that enable the students to realize about that (false) possibility, was creative, which is, the process of exploring and learning about anything.</p>
      <p>While having full access to code projects, there are many that are focused in what we call "the bad intention", which is the <b>Red Teams</b>, in IT, while the ones that care about the defensive security are the <b>Blue Team</b>. In any case, in this article I will talk a bit about this <b>Red</b> people and talk about the Morality of their functionality.</p>
      <p>One known and regulary updated is the project of <a href="http://github.com/A-poc/RedTeam-Tools" target="_blank">A-poc</a> user, that we can explore, download/clone and use and test. The <a href="https://github.com/infosecn1nja/Red-Teaming-Toolkit">InfoSecN1nja</a> tool kit, with more resources about the same subject, the <a href="https://github.com/bigb0sss/RedTeam-OffensiveSecurity" target="_blank">BigB0sss</a> Offensive notes and tools, the <a href="https://github.com/zan8in/afrog" target="_blank">Zan8in</a> and the Afrog tool made in Go, <a href="https://github.com/DavidProbinsky/RedTeam-Physical-Tools" target="_blank">David Probinsky</a> physhical tools references, <a href="https://github.com/Ixve/Red-Team-Tools" target="_blank">Ixve</a> Cracked tools for Windows users, some <a href="https://github.com/ihebski/A-Red-Teamer-diaries" target="_blank">Diaries</a> from professionals, some other <a href="https://github.com/0xsyr0/Red-Team-Playbooks" target="_blank">Playbooks</a>, and some other tools to use on our favorite <a href="https://github.com/i-am-shodan/USBArmyKnife" target="_blank">USB</a> to be more unpredictable for all others, that can be used for almost <a href="https://github.com/Astrosp/Awesome-OSINT-For-Everything" target="_blank">everything</a>, or try to build your own <a href="https://github.com/sneakerhax/Arsenal" target="_blank">Arsenal</a> of tools to use against anyone, while just companies will fight back, since they have access to the logs of activities. Many others exist and being udated regularely.</p>
      <p>Now, the Ethical problem that can be compared to guns is what I already descrive above, in this aspect of having access to tools (for free), that simplify the "Path that anyone would need to know", to be able to do the same, without using a tool. So, as we know, that is a reality for some years, while the "Ethical hacktivity" only cares about Industry or govermental. In any case, the result of these tools can represent that possibility, while attackers or Red members, could focus only in creating more value to the ones they are able to attack, to make them better, not to destroy them.</p>
      <p>The only problem in history that guns produce, is that "soldiers" don't always use them against other soldiers, but against children, woman and man, without being soldiers. So, the Ethical Law that I would implement, is that the condtion of the attacker cannot be seen as bad, since the bad choice was to give to anyone the possibility to use it, against anyone. You see, by the being conscious about what guns do, we should control guns flow, since any children can use it without the understanding of what that tool aims to give. So, in the condition of having a population with guns, if some of them make use of guns, they are only using what was already permited to be used, so, we cannot criminalize this person, but only those who give them access to those tools.</p>
      <p>If you are a father or mother, you probably don't wish to leave your child in the middle of some danger place. You don't wish that, because You are Conscious of what represents Danger and therefor, you know about the probability. Is only about <a href="./clearAsWater.html">Security</a>.</p>
