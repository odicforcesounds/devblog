      <!--       BODY -->
      <p>Every Thief Dream would be like: You pay me to work, so I can live without working. </p>
      <p>Is what Governments do. They ask money to everyone, being private or company, as a way to give them the license to live in peace.</p>
      <p>If you are a thief and you dream about it, join the Government.</p>
      <p>Is forbidden to use Guns and Bombs? Think twice, because the Governments can, without your permission. They will not ask you if you agree with them, since if you don't, you become a target of them. :) They are so criminal that I normally laught a lot just by reading the news, while I can assume that, someone need to have that "power", I may be wrong and if we destroy everything that was developed in human history, no one will.</p>
      <p>Now, there is some kind of useful things that goverments can do. First is to monitor everything you do. Is against privacy? It is, but depending on the situation, you may agree with that. If I stole all your money, you will accept that the goverment, break the privacy laws, or else, everyone could stole anything without being arrested. Laws can be a bit contradictory, but if you think twice, they are not the worst thing we can do. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yBMkQrpyb4&" target="_blank">Here</a> is a awesome talk that talks about how lazy all goverments are, while with that attitute, demonstrating how criminal they are. You know, if you accept to give some "investment freedom" to companies, without caring the potencial of their abuse, you are lazy and criminal at the same time, mainly because you (the goverment) represent everyone else. If people "close their eyes" to criminal movements, since they will ear some money by being shut up, they are being criminal. Is what the Goverments do. They are shut up, because the company payed some good money to have the freedom they have. Legislation can help? Maybe can, but what helps is to understand that everyone can do anything, with or without laws. Is a personal choice, not a impossible archivement that we dream. The only common details that most everyone in the world dream, is to get some money without doing anything. The Church is alive by that condition, as the money they get, was given by those who work hard. Some Religious groups are like Goverments, as they were in Time, above any goverment or king. Even the King pay to the church to live free.  </p>
      <p>Is what I call: The source of Evil. That "goodness" that aims to control others, can be Evil as the Devil Would be if the Devil exist.</p>
      <p>Anyway, everything can be used for Good or for Evil, since depend on intention, not in the source of what we use.</p>
      <p>Old lessons, with more than 1.000.000 centuries. Always repeating, since in on the repetitions that we learn to do something better, no matter what it is. </p>
