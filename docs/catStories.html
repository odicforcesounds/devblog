      <!--       BODY -->
      <p>One day a friend comes to me and say: "You need a Cat", and I say: "What? Ok, where is that Cat?"</p>
      <p>Then she take me into some place that get cats and give them vacines and all the legal stuff non-Rational-Living-Beings need to have to be Legal, and a room full of Cats was there, waiting for the new, who may wish to take one or two. The cats where in little boxes, with a small hole where their little "hands" could touch the "outer space" of their place, that look like <a href="./jailVSvms.html">jails</a>.</p> 
      <p>All of them were nice to me, while this one, did atttack me, when I was passing by. I look to him and say: "you want to talk with me?" and he try to attack me again, or maybe he was puting out his little leg, to say, touch me, "I am here". I don't know what reasons are behind this connection, but I ask the lady to open the box and he jump into the floor and like some cool little dog do, he lay down, waiting for my choice. After he gets home, he have access to the roof, garden and many other garden. Every day he goes for a morning walk, while I go to work. After some hours, before night time, there he is, waiting for me. The cool thing is: he behave like a dog, as he is always after me, at home. Outside he doesn't follow me, but his instincts. I really like this relations of trust. Without my imposition against his freedom, I open the garden door, and without my impositions to arrest him at home, he comes again to sleep with me. </p>
      <p>If this is possible with Cats, why children have so many troubles to do the same? Maybe their parents and the System, didn't understand that children like the majority of adults, cats, dogs, and other living beings, need to feel that no one is arrest them eternally, to feel confortable and go back to "home", when they could go without comming to home again. Is the natural flow of things and humanity should learn about that simplicity. Denying something as being a eternal denial, will create "content" to become the express that denies what denies. So, is like drugs. Anything can be a drug: tabacco, caffee, sugar, salt, running, jumping, boxing, sweeming, etc.. Everything, because drugs do bad when we have a compulsive behavior that ask repetitions of the experience "we had yesterday", again and again, and again again again again...  That the effect of Drugs. Naturally that some drugs do worst than others in a long term, like sugar, salt, jumping, running, etc... And Look what happen in society, while the majority is Christian, which share that knowledge in "the forbidden is the source of desire", they continue fighting against drugs commercialization, while drug dealers don't force anyone to consume drugs, and people who wish to consume them, they are conscience about the bad results of that consuming.  </p>
      <p>If this reality the "Justices" fight against are not jokes, then Education is a joke. </p>
