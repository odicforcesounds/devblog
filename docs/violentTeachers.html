      <p>I think this will be the last post to talk about <a href="./wordpress_attacks.html">these</a> animals that didn't learn to <a href="./againstPatterns.html">read</a> or to <a href="./motivatingAttackers.html">think</a>, while I create a lot of <a href="./excitedMoments.html">articles</a> to guide their choice. After several <a href="./wp-stupid.html">articles</a> that explain in a rational and explicit way how this site is made, I quit from teaching them. Is in that precise moment of Time, that I almost understand why some teachers lose their mind and become violent to the students. </p>
      <p>Practical example: Click on <a href="https://github.com/odicforcesounds/devblog">these</a> link. Do you see any <b>.env</b> file? Do you see any <b>php</b> file? Do you see any <b>JavaScript</b> library? Do you see any <b>NodeJS</b> library?</p>
      <p>After this questions, they probably say <b>YES</b> to all, since they will <b>REFUSE</b> to read them, we can ask ourself's, if they learn how to read. </p>
      <p>Since I have no professional obligation to teach them how to read, I make fun of them, writting these <a href="./wp-stupid.html">articles</a>, but for a real teacher, I almost understand that feeling, where hiting them while questioning them, is the best technique that <i>calm down the mind</i> of the teacher.</p>
      <p>Naturally I don't agree with this approach, that was used in the last centuries, but sometimes I <a href="./phpLovers.html">think</a> about it and I see something good in that <a href="./mar.html">approach</a> that is really bad!</p>
      <p>I will not spend more time writting to these "things" that probaly are like <b>Irracional Animals</b> that cannot think or read, while I do not agree that educating Irracional Animals we should use any kind of Violence, for these specific cases that the probability, is that they are <b>Rational</b>, a small desire grow on me, dreaming about this approach, to satisfy my soul. </p>
