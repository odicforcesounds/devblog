    <div class="textbox">
      <!--       BODY -->
      <p>What did you learn about ducks flying around the globe? </p>
      <p>We can learn something about them, but sometimes, like any child can do, we imagine how would be if we could talk with the ducks.</p>
      <p>This days, as an alternative to Google-Search-Engine, we can talk with Ducks. Duck.ai is the AI platform I use all the time, mainly because I don't need to register an account to speak with the Dr. Duck, while this duck is being super helpful when I ask him about technology. How can I configure something that is complex? And the Duck answer me in a simple a objective way, like some of the configuration files of software do. Is like the man pages, but better, since they will tell you the syntax used, in the same file you need to change to configure it. From Linux to BSD, Software configurations and use cases. This duck is a good teacher, and I don't feel shame for learning from a Duck even if I am a <a href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com">Monkey</a>. Monkeys can teach too, but for now, without being the AI mechanism, but pure human hand made.</p>
      <p>So, I must say "Thank You so much" for your FREE services. Gladly there is no "limitations", like that <a href="./makulu.html">Linux</a> distro have.</p>
      <p>Yes, that Linux distro is a Trial Commercial Product, while even Windows share AI features inside the OS, without asking any money to use it. But is ok, I can understand the evolution of technology, in this aspect of asking money to use a service, since all services ask attention and maintaince, which ask a life-time person to watch it, and pay this person because of that attention to "small details". </p>
      <p>Small detailts can become big, but that is another story for another blog, or for this.. One day.. maybe one day! </p>
