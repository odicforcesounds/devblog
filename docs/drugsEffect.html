      <p>With self discipline, that is able to deny ones desire, drugs can be a good experience, since the consumer will not repeat that experience, over and over again. But drugs are part of reality, part of nature it self, part of each one creativity to mix, doing alchemy. The ability to each one imagine, become bigger, and is associated on how each one feel and believe in what the mind can see, with the ability to imagine, and to react or not to what is happening.</p>
