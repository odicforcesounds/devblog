    <p>In this blog, I already wrote about the <a href="./theGoodOnChristianity.html">DARK SIDE</a> of Christianity, but
      in some other post I wrote about the <a href="./historicalEvent.html">GOODNESS</a> of Christianity. It is
      important to me to make reference of the bad things that this Religion groups did in Time, while is fair to write
      about the <b>Bright Side</b> of it.</p>
    <p>So, lets talk about the Positive side, or the Bright Side of Light. First of all, I would like to say that, in a
      comparative review between the Muslin and Christianity, Christianity is 1000000% better than the Muslin, even if
      in some small details, the Muslin demonstrate some extra values that are better than Christianity. Something that
      is refered in the <a href="./MuslinLaws.html">older</a> article about that religion of Eternal Enslavement, that
      is NOT fair to anyone. </p>
    <p>So lets start with the Good stuff: Theatre. Theatre was for centuries something seen as "Dangerous", while
      Theatre create a positive revolution in our societies. Today we have a big list of Theatre styles, that are very
      interesting to see, mainly if you appreciate the Art of representing what could be without being, like all
      spiritual practices are. </p>
    <p>Then I wish to talk about the Music and how Christianity Open their Minds to accept what is not Classical Music.
      From Electronic Music to Psychedelic Rock, Rock, Heavy Metal and inside of Heavy Metal we have even more
      categories, like Power Metal, Thrash Metal, Death Metal, Black Metal, Grind Core, Doom Metal, Stoner, and maybe
      more. One of the most interesting perspective of one of this Heavy Metal styles for me, is the Black Metal. I
      rarely like the Sound of these bands, but some of them declare themselfs as being "satanic". This is reallty
      funny, because Satan is a Christian Figure. So, even if they show themself's as "Anti-Christ", they are feeding
      the Idea of Christianity, because Satan is part of Christianity investions and Literature. In their style there is
      a Painful expression that is aims to be a criticism about how Christ did suffer and How painful Christianity was
      in the last centuries to many cultures. These kind of Music styles, are only possible, because Christianity open
      their own Mind to the possibility of "everything being just a joke", while accepting the wrongness of their own
      history.</p>
    <p>Even if some of these bands take too seriuosly their emotions in form of Art, some others keep growing this idea
      that Christianity is something bad, while being Good at the same Time. There is a Movie called "Metal Head", that
      I recommend to those who would like to explore this topics, that can be very interesting to think. This movie
      treat the "emotional problem" of how people can see Evil in Christianity, while at the same time, it demonstrate
      how Christianity keeps trying to be Good and Practice that Goodness, based on Jesus Teachings. </p>
    <p>Psychedelic Trance, Techno, House Music, Chilout, Hard Techno and many many others is the result of Christianity
      Freedom. While Blues, Soul and others are based on African Cultures Rithmics. </p>
    <p>Today I can say "God is a Chicken" and even if the Muslin would see this afirmation as something <a
        href="./offensiveMessage.html">offensive</a>, by the RATIONAL perspective, it is NOT, since if we assume that
      God
      Create the Universe and everything and everyone,
      the Chicken is as well, God creation, and by saying that God is a Chicken, we are adding God Essence to the
      Chicken. So, God is a Rock, a Stone, a Lion, a Ant, a Corcodille, the Wind, the Sun, the Planet, the Universe, a
      Dog, a Cat and everything is (<a href="./style_of_god.html">God</a> Essence). You can imagine how many MURDERING
      the Abrahamic religions did in their History, as result of reacting without thinking. I really hope that Hell
      exist, and the main
      3 groups that kill billions of inocents, go to Hell for ALL Eternity! (since this is the POSITIVE perspective for
      Them!</p>
    <p>I reallty think that Buddhism and Hinduism have knowledge that is important to understand, mainly because it is
      focused on the Self-Discipline that we should develop to be able to live in society without reactions against what
      others may express, but I don't wish to say that Christianity is only bad, or only good. Like everything in Life,
      there is something Good and something Bad, and we should understand what is Good and what is Bad to make better
      choices in the Future.</p>
