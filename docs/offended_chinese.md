# Offended Chinese

I was for some days to Spain ( Coru√±a ), and I found that there are a lot of Chinese stores of different kind. One of them was a liquid Icescreem with some small-balls inside. 

Personally I don't like to mix liquid stuff with anything that is not liquid and therefor, when the girl ask me if I like, I said: I don't like because I don't like to mix non-liquid stuff with liquid. 

Then I ask her if she can do the same without those Bubble-Crap.. and she got offended saying: "this is chinese culture and I don't need to change it for you". Then I try to tell her that **The Condition of adaptability is inevitable, mainly when we leave our origins**. She answer me that she was speaking in Spanish with me, demonstrating that she was even more mad with me, which result in calling some other Chinese man. 

I install an application to translate text in chinese and show the guy what I wish to tell her, and with that attitude of mine, she open her ears to listen better, as she demonstrate she was able to think about what I was telling her. 

Being Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamite, Brasilian, Spanish, Portuguese, English, Americanish ( lol ) .. what ever your language is, you should learn the language of the country you are going to live. And Chinese normally do, but sometimes they confuse things.

Not only Chinese, but the majority of all restaurants in the world, they try to adapt the plates to the taste of their clients. 

Is not about loosing your culture.. is about trying to satisfy your clients.
