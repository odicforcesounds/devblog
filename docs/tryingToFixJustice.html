      <p>You can look without the mission to find. You are only in a state of appreciation, without objectives without a pre intention. Maybe you will find it faster than you think you could, since was without believing, that you could. Or you can start in one point and verify(compare) if each picture is the image you see. This will take you longer, if you compare information. If you don't, it will take you even longer than any other objective in life. Is what "Learning" means anyway. It is in that quality that can identify a subject or object, and with that, take or not, some action.</p>
      <p>How drugs are a Crime? Well, only when someone impose drugs consume to someone who doesn't desire to consume. Only!!! Drugs dealers don't impose others to consume. Some people use drugs to take advange to some situation. Then, those specific persons did commit a crime. Is like those who put some pills in others drink, to take something from them or to rape them. In that aspect, I agree that, those persons commited a crime, Not those who consume by Free Will of Choice ! You go into some #American jails and you find that the majority are there, just because they consume some Haxixe or Weed. They didn't commit any crime. If they kill and did some creepy things, ok, I agree they should be arrested. But if they only consume, no, I don't agree. Is in this aspect that Justice systems can be Stupid, by not questioning what they are doing. Orders can be followed even if we question orders. This days, we can make better choices because we can get more information about any subject, and with that, make better choices. The same with you question an Order. Even in Militar / Army perspective. For example, let me imagine that all soldiers in History, who did rate, torture and kill many inocents, they were only producing orders. To God, you can be guilty, to me, the ones who give the order are the guilty, even if I agree that we should question any order ( don't you question God Will ) ???

      Like drugs and many other things, drugs can be good, if you are the one who will consume and you control the cycle of consuming it. But you can use what would be good for you, with someone who doesn't have that desire, and from that moment on, what is good, become bad. Naturally is not the "thing" but who did develop the "Flow" of the thing. Farmacy use drugs too, and anyone can abuse, on consuming it, so, Farmacy drugs are bad? Make me laught Please!

      I don't put in the same "bag", guns. The intention of Guns is to kill. You cannot give birth to some living being, by your will when using guns. Naturally, if guns were used to apply into the self that use guns, then I could agree that guns are good. "If you encounter any problem, kill yourself and solve the problem." Even then, I don't see it positive. But to almost everything in this life, we can change the objective of functionality by intentions!
      </p>
      <p>
      Computers can be good and bad. Naturally is not the computer that is good or bad, since computers are just tools. But, with those tools you can do good or bad things. Like knifes are. Like the food is. Like dogs can become. Like boats can "dance" with the irregularities of the Sea. Like Music is: (sound is a powerful weapon) Can make you confuse a simple question, and interpret that question, as an afirmation. And the only things that change was Sound.
