      <p>I continue fascinated with all these attackers around the globe, using <a href="./mar.html">those</a> tools, that somewhere in Time, they work, but after the <a href="./theTransformation.html">Greatful Transformation</a> of technology, they are obsolete. Wordpress popularity exist and I cannot deny they have a <b>cool</b> platform there, but if their users don't update wordpress versions, they can be victims of this attacks that are, like they are, stoped in Time. </p>
      <p>I am a bit Stoped in Time too, I cannot deny it, but I use the Basic HTML + CSS to create this content, and with that in mind, I don't need a Database to share my thoughts on this subdomain, which is just another blog, without fancy animations or database queries. Like <a href="https://book.odicforcesounds.com">books</a>, if you wish to search, you need to read them, and maybe your memory will help you to find the content you wish, because you use your brain and think about the context mixed with Author style, which in this case in me. And I admit that sometimes I don't know which post "speak" about some subject that I am "speaking" again. Is important to know that I am in silence. I don't speak, I wrote.</p>
      <p>At least, with all the information I share about security in this blog, which is making reference of the original authors of that work, that make reference to many others, and the cycle of reference create a Tree, bigger as the Web can be, since this days we are even more connected than the past, even if sometimes, the reasons of connections are not for the best we have or can offer, functionality in societies can become much better.</p>
      <p>For centuries, people where blocked for studying, which result in being <b>Stoped in Time</b>, but this day, only those who refuse evolution, will continue <b>Stoped Somewhere in Time</b>.</p>
