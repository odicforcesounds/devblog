      <p>I found a new technique to solve this PHP Frameworks Exploiters attackers that come from many places in the world.</p>
      <p>You know, like I try to describe I could try to report to the police about them, but since the probability of Police being corrupt is Big, I discover this little trick, to report to the police, without reporting to the police, about their activity. It is so easy, that they going to LOVE to go to PRISON, without understanding the reason. Like <a href="./stupidMastodonLaws.html">this</a> stupid Laws of Mastodon Networks do, but better, because I will always try to be fair to "You"!</p>
      <p>It will take some time to apply, since only "two" are already defined as a rule. For each new attack that come against this site, I will setup new rules for them too. Sometimes we give them the opportunity to learn and to change what they do, but when there is a explicit declaration of that rejection, we don't have another choice that be unfair to many and fair to few. So I will repeat myself with this: </p>
      <p class="center">To be Fair to Few (Condition) - We can be Unfair to Many (result)</p>
