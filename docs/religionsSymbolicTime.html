      <p class="center">If Time Was Built withing about self's, <br>
      then the Expression of Time, it is the Expression of Our Self's, <br>
      as Result of Time Itself.
      </p>
      <p class="center">Let me try to describe how it is. <br>
      Somewhere in Time, an Event Happen with Jesus Christ <br>
      <br>
      Is where I born. I born in a Christian Society, <br>
      and it where I live. A peaceful town <br>
      far away from all symbology used in this sites. <br>
      But You understand the logic of Time, don't you? <br>
      Since it looks that everything repeats again<br>
      as you try to understand the beauty of mean <br>
      with different names, stories and beliefs, <br>
      there is always a <a href="./theTransformation.html">transformation</a> that declare peace <br>
      Remembering the past, memory that all need, <br>
      to understand the self and the present, <br>
      in the name of Fantasy, images created using the brain, <br>
      expressions of creativity, liberating fears expanding life <br>
      we are travelers of Time and we recreate with a new face <br>
      what was in Time, <br>
      Time of Expression of Time. <br>
      While if I Speak (no I am writting - I am in Silence) <br>
      about the Dark Side of <a href="./historicalEvent.html">History</a>, the reason in on Philosophy. <br>
      The art of thinking to create the art of transformation <br>
      what is Stucked in Time. <br>
      Because we all wish to see the transformation of Time <br>
      We Point to What we Wish to see in the Future,<br>
      as Result of Our Dreams. <br>
      Sometimes I like Christian Cultures, <br>
      where there is a sense of "family" <br>
      even if people are not family <br>
      a sense of Union, even if is not<br>
      A sense of Duty, even if is not, on Help Others <br>
      A sense of Responsability, even if is not<br>
      A sense of Freedom, even if is not. <br> 
      Am I lying? No I am focusing on the positive side of Transformation of Time <br>
      The news repetition of the same kind of events as News <br>
      Don't deny what I did wrote in this electronic body that doesn't feel <br>
      No Racism right? No criminality Right? <br>
      Is the Perfect world to live Jesus Christ Dream, <br>
      Don't you think? Feel before thinking <br>
      like all cool living beings do. <br>
      The necessary Freedom to be Creative, if Society Permite. <br>
      Which is true that permite, <br>
      since the world create awesome Art to be in Memory <br>
      even if sometimes, is part of what was forgotten <br>
      Learning to think and <a href="./questionOrders.html">questioning</a> to learn about the others. <br>
      I really like <a href="./myCulture.html">Christian</a> Cultures, <br>
      while sometimes it feels that they don't care, if we are doing Business. <br>
      While that is a common Style for many, few don't mix things like I do. <br>
      Let us celebrate the differences of the rate that Time as to Offer <br>
      Since we all like to Make Fun of Our Cultures. <br>
      And If you don't make fun of your cultures, <br>
      you probably didn't find issues that in your perspective should change <br>
      from the original content, all can become better. <br>
      Like all Memories from all History, <br>
      they are here to remember that You should become better <br>
      Far away from Guns and all those Homosexual Tools, <br>
      used to Penetrate Others Bodies without their Permission. <br>
      Since if you should Love, you should work in the direction <br>
      to make it possible for "all", by what we cannot control <br>
      which is the <a href="./beingFair.html">Flow of Time</a>.
