      <p>What kind of book you like? You can select books by their title, or by their description, or maybe someone gave you a book and you don't know anything about it. The book, will give you the same experience that you can create to all others, by writting something about something. Like this text are. They describe something. They cannot create something since the only ones who can create something with texts, are humans. The subject can be technical and if you have logical skills, and you learn math and physics, this technical book will help you to understand reality and with it, maybe manipulate it in a healthy way, since you already know how it works. Can be about a spiritual perspective of God or about life it self, which is more realistic, since God need deeper reasons to change reality, while it is always in a "musical way". You can try to understand the God by reading the Bible or Al Quran or the Torah, or Book of the Dead, or many other simple texts that describe what God is, even if God is more than something else that is not in the self, which is true that is not, at least in my experience, but that is another subject. I cannot define God or God Will, I can Only Define <a href="./style_of_god.html">The Style of God</a>, which is knowledge for Children. Whatever humanity did, with this simplicity is what Humanity chose, since God gave us the Free Will of Choice. So, At least for me, God is only a function that can interact with us, if the conditions to create reason, exist. Else, God wouldn't ever pay attention to what is running as expected, by the probability of being conscience. Is what God can give. Conscience. Anyway, you can like police books, since you are police too, may help you to understand the creativity of criminality, or maybe you are a criminal and you like to know how investigation process work, so you can escape from them. Can be many another subjects. Or maybe you just like to imagine how the experience of both criminal and police are expressed in those books, and how everything is presented by the author, and you are just enjoying your potencial to imagine, without feeling any desire to create the content of the book, which should be more or less what the majority should do, while that is not always true. Maybe you like Computers and technology and you wish to use Linux or Windows, maybe you will never feel the desire to read more and be able to create sites or applications, but that depends always in what you desire not the object that is used to create something new, which can be good or bad, like everything can be, since depends on intentions and in many other things that we cannot control, since Not Even God can. ;) </p>
      <p>How did you learn to read? Maybe from what you read, you dream and made different choices inspired in what you read. Now, the question is: Did you think before chosing?</p>
      <p>Is like this Old subject that is part of <a href="./tryingToFixJustice.html">Justice</a> elements: If the text say that something is "forbiden", justice elements don't question why it is. Guns in most countries are prohibid, but police use guns. Why they use them? I don't know, but most of the time they did, they are condend for using it. While in countrie that guns are not forbiden, police can kill without any reason. Did anyone question the use of a creation that can only be used to kill? (that is what people speak all this time about "justice") since justice for many centuries did the same in the name of Justice or even worst, in the name of God. Does Justice systems think? I guess they do, while is true that huanity did embrace guns as some divine object, creating in reality what we can see on TV. God already bless all, by giving them the experince of being alive. Everything else, God don't need to do much if not only, give conscience to the ones that can be used to share that conscience, in case that, that conscience doesn't exist, or just to remember it, to make us think. </p>
      <p>Think and Create, if You wish to, else just ignore, even by reading what ever the content is, you can ignore and reject the content. So, as you can see. Free Will of Choice.</p>
