      <p>What kind of book you like? You can select books by their title, or by their description, or maybe someone gave you a book and you don't know anything about it. The book, will give you the same experience that you can create to all others, by writting something about something. Like this text are. They describe something. They cannot create something since the only ones who can create something with texts, are humans. The subject can be technical and if you have logical skills, and you learn math and physics, this technical book will help you to understand reality and with it, maybe manipulate it in a healthy way, since you already know how it works. Can be about a spiritual perspective of God or about life it self, which is more realistic, since God need deeper reasons to change reality, while it is always in a "musical way". You can try to understand the God by reading the Bible or Al Quran or the Torah, or Book of the Dead, or many other simple texts that describe what God is, even if God is more than something else that is not in the self, which is true that is not, at least in my experience, but that is another subject. I cannot define God or God Will, I can Only Define <a href="./style_of_god.html">The Style of God</a>, which is knowledge for Children. Whatever humanity did, with this simplicity is what Humanity chose, since God gave us the Free Will of Choice. So, At least for me, God is only a function that can interact with us, if the conditions to create reason, exist. Else, God wouldn't ever pay attention to what is running as expected, by the probability of being conscience. Is what God can give, nothing more. </p>
