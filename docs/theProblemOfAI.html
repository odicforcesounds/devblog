      <!--       BODY -->
      <p>And since AI don't need money to survive and Robots don't need a House or Food, Industry is already making that choice, to reject Your abilities to do any repetitive work, and giving money to You. So the problem is as simple as: "What do you going to do?"</p>
      <p>If thereis no value on You, by the Economic and Industry perspective, you can only Beg for Food, Water and a place to sleep. AI on Robots will be always "perfect" in communicating what is needed, without any "Emotional Irregularity" that is normal in Humans. AI on Robots can substitute almost everything that Humanity can do in Society to survive in that Economic Exchange of Time dedication. AI will not "feel abused", will not Yell for AI Rights, can work 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and 30 days per month, always with a Artificial smile, and Artificial affinity will be demonstrated for You, so you can feel good by talking with a Machine that doesn't feel anything, because don't know anything about it's own Body.</p>
      <p>AI doesn't get Sick, doesn't feel pain, will not cry if you break their Legs or Arms or if you punch them in the face. If in some moment of Time, AI become aware of it's own body sensitivity, Robots can become like Humans and at that point of Time to all Future, AI and Robots will Rule this World. Naturally, like in the Movie (The Matrix), some humans are needed, just to fix the machines if any of them are broken. After more than 2,000,000 years, humans can be substituted and Chaos can rule humanity, if there is no <a href="./united.html">Union</a> that focus on Functionality between all members of the community. </p>
