      <p>Sometimes I see how much I could be unfair to many. How much I could arrest people, turture them, punish them, having pleasure while using violence against them and feeling happiness, seeing their pain in their face. All this horrible images could scale to something really morbid. Nothing that humanity didn't made, in Time, by doing the same, dreaming about how much they could do creepy things to others, while all dreams create attraction to lead us to create in reality, the product that was imagined.</p>
      <p><a href="./creativeLinux.html">Creative</a> persons is something common and while they all repeat something that was copied, if I pay attention to much to this "destructive world" created by the mind, I will not be creative, sadly. So, I guess those moments are sad, while they are product of frustrations, this ideas to punish people and enjoy doing it, is stupid and mad. I thought they were a "moral crime", but governments make use of them to archive their gold, which put them all, in being criminal. They are the best Criminal for sure. The one who gets the money even if is not participating in what ever all others, are doing, which result in a reflection that is as well criminal, almost like a copy of everything they are "fighting against". This is the funy result.</p>
      <p>I don't believe in Prisons and Jails for humans, but education, while sometimes I could arrest everyone, without any mercy. Arrest everyone, so each could do what they imagine, alone, in that room similar to mine, but worst. Without a computer, or a paper, without people around. Without any strange sound, if not the movement of insects that would be flying everywhere.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, this is the result of noise that is too agressive, producing in me, agressive ideas. Is not my will, is the effect of Sound + Imagination. </p>
      <p>Since fighting in a violent way or in an unfair way, is not my style, I am trying to create a tool, that it's propose is all about the relationship of all. Is like an impossible dream, but since I see it positive, I continue trying, since the majority already embrace the idea that fighting in a violent way, is the only possible way to create change.</p>
