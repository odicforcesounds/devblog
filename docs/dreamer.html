      <p>Sometimes I see how much I could be unfair to many. How much I could arrest people, turture them, punish them, having pleasure while using violence against them and feeling happiness, seeing their pain in their face. All this horrible images could scale to something really morbid. Nothing that humanity didn't made, in Time, by doing the same, dreaming about how much they could do creepy things to others, while all dreams create attraction to deal us to create in reality, the product that was imagined.</p>
      <p><a href="./creativeLinux.html">Creative</a> persons is something common and while they all repeat something that was copied, if I pay attention to much to this "imaginative" world, I will not be creative, sadly. So, I guess those moments are sad, while they are product of frustrations, this ideas to punish people and enjoy doing it, is stupid and mad.</p>
      <p>I don't believe in Prisons and Jails for humans, but education, while sometimes I could arrest everyone, without any mercy. Arrest everyone, so each could do what they imagine, alone, in that room similar to mine, but worst. Without a computer, or a paper, without people around. Without any strange sound, if not the movement of insects that would be flying everywhere.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, this is the result of noise that is too agressive, producing in me, agressive ideas. Is not my will, is the effect of Sound + Imagination. </p>
