      <p>I think that I already wrote about this subject, in another post from this blog, but I like so much about this psychologic event, that I wish to write about it again. One of the most common event this days between society, is the <a href="./offensiveMessage.html">Offensive</a> messages that anyone can use against anyone. When the content of the message is True, those who didn't learn about self <a href="./chinesEducation.html">discipline</a>, will react against those who spoke the truth without their will to expose it, while if the content is a lie, since it doesn't affect us, we can laught and smile. So, it looks that some offenders are protected by the police and Justice systems, while the ones who did offend, by speaking the truth, victimized, like Jesus Christ was, somewhere in Time, for the same reason. Being offensive is not a recommended way to behave, but have some really awesome results, since the targets of the declarations can feel themself's, being part of what was declared or not. Is how we (intelligent people) verify and validate information (within auto-comparative techniques that our brain do without thinking too much about that logic functionality that is needed to validate information). Is how computers validate information too. They compare "what they know" to "what is 'new'", even if that 'new' is the same of the 'old'. If it is the same, then is Valid. If it is not the same, is not valid. Even if the brain and humans are more complex than any computer, we follow those patterns to build what we know to be, computers. Without a inspirational base, we couldn't create what is unknown to us. </p>
      <p>As I try to explain in some text area of <a href="./style_of_god.html">this</a> article, words don't change reality, as they only potention our ability to imagine, for sure that is not a "good experience" to imagine something that you are not, but to imagine what you are not, doesn't transform you in what you believe you are. While is true that no one become what others describe them to be, anyone can imagine how is to be, what we are not, just by their ability to imagine that possibility. So, is like when you say to some child that she is invincible. You know that she is not, and maybe she knows that too, while that perspective give her some strength to continue as she was invincible. The same if you tell her that she is something bad. She doesn't become bad, just because you said. That is one of the biggest lessons that Theatre can teach about each. Even if someone believe, even if that representation of being looks real, what is real is only the behavior of believers that create the same of being true with being false. Old knowledge, very know at this days, while sometimes I think that people didn't learn anything at all, resulting in what we can see in many aspects of society.</p>
      <p>Psychologist, don't have the objective or the desire to condend others, but to guide them to do better choices. Someone can go into the psychenalist because they feel low, but their feeling is based on some "abstraction" that is power their minds to be, what the mind is focusing to be, and therefor they become what the mind is poiting to be, as result of being. That trick is used within psychology to change those who are stucked in some imaginative realm, created by themselfs. </p>
      <p>Some popular knowledge say: The Truth will make you feel pain (if the truth is by your will, something that you wish to hide), and after than painful experience of realizing what is true on you, you are Free. So, be free and Dance with me! </p>
