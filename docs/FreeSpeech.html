      <p class="center">Tribute to Free Speech</p>
      <p>Be offended and announce to the world, what disturb you. Laught and we can say that you are dealing better with what disturb you. In case the problem is something else above the self, being offensive is the way to extract in a faster way, what is possibly true or not, since most people don't use the Self Discipline and will React.. Announcing to the World what Truth Disburb them. In case the declaration that is offensive is true, the individual can react, while if is a lie, the individual will question and get admired. What? Is this a joke? No I don't... </p>
      <p>So, being <a href="./offensiveMessage.html">offensive</a>, is part of the mechanism of Free Speech, since <b>Words don't change reality</b>, what can change is the behavior of individuals that didn't solve the (information that cause them to react) in themselfs, because if some truth is true on you and you accept that others declare that truth to others, you can feel shame, but you will never react badly, because is a subject that you are proud to share with everyone..</p>
      <p>If the information that is declared in some truth that you didn't solve on you (you are not sure if it is or not), then any "Truth", can be offensive to you. Else the normal behavior, would be by accepting that what is True or by denying. Whatever the end of a long discussion of what is true or not, doesn't make the conclusions, true or not, since that verification, need to happen on you. It You who need to validate the information that is declared as possibly True on You. </p>
      <p>For example, in the above Link describe a possible offensive message, while the best answer to that "offensive question", is "yes, sometimes I am".. You assume what is True and by that condition what is Offensive is Not, because you accept it.</p>
      <p class="center">In case you are against Free Speech</p>
      <p>We can start with you. You cannot speak. (nothing at all, since any word that you can speak, it will be from Your Free Will of Choice, and therefor, you cannot speak. If we apply this rule to everyone on Earth, Cities would become super quiet, like in Japan or China, but in fact it would be worst, because no one could communicate with anyone. O_o </p>
      <p>I think this people that try to block "Free Speech", didn't think about what "Speech in Prison" means. Can mean that only the other prisoners ear you. Maybe no one can ear because you are far from all cities in the world. Then we should create a new rule for you, which is to "Screen", hoping that people on the cities, ear you.</p>
      <p class="center">
      My life is quiet. But if people wish to screen saying something true or not, I am ok with them. <br>
      if many people get together to declare something <br>
      or they are in party <br>
      or they are trying to change something (<a href="./jews.html">Wrong</a>)
