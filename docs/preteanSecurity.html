      <p>Mastering a language take some years, while to exploit some code can take some minutes.</p>
      <p>Proteansec is just another blog that I read from my favorite RSS reader, while the blog share the full article via RSS, which I can read without opening a Browser. One of their articles is about a Wordpress plugin that have some vulnerabilities, while most of the 'new web', is, since developers didn't master the language and don't always follow the best practice, believing that (their code will not be target) from some random user, while that is possible false, since all devices connected on Internet are always being target of some kind of attack and most ISP routers are a bit out of date. The article explains how SQL Injections are made, while the technique is a bit old, even if most developers don't pay attention to this specific topics. I am glad that I don't use PHP or JavaScript or NodeJS or Python, or any other language that is not HTML and CSS. In any case, the known <a href="./EthicalLawsOnIT.html">ExploitDB</a> site, is always updating with new vulnerabilities, sharing the code that can be used to exploit the plugin or service. In case the reader knows how to run the code, using one of the most common framework to attack remote users, many can exploit others just for fun and without knowing how that code works or how the code can break remote services. Is like giving a gun to a child and expect that this child can kill anyone, which is true, since is only in a distance of a "click". This article is made by a PHP developer, which lead me to believe that he already master the language, while almost attack attempts I have on this domain, are most of them, against PHP frameworks like Wordpress. This is the dark side of <a href="./becauseIsPopular.html">Popularity</a>, that simplify the life of "dumbs", who have no desire to lose some time reading and learning about the web. </p>
      <p>Even if I don't use PHP in any of my sub domains, I like to understand how this stuff is working. Then I feel better to see that most of this attacks will fail against my sites. I am glad about it, since the number of attacks is growing and with that in mind, sometimes I feel a bit insecure about how much these sites will not break. They will not break because it is hosted in Github and to change the code you need to commit the code that you wish to change. Anyway, the attackers that I got until now, don't use their <a href="./usingTheBrain.html">brain</a> which is good, because we always like to have fun seeing others failing. Computers can be <a href="./awesome_story.html">awesome</a> but papers and pens are even better. I keep using them, like I keep using static content without any logic behind. In this perspective, I feel a bit "Stoped in Time", but for this specific topic, is good to be stoped in Time and use odd and old languages, like my original language is. </p>
