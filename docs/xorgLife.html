      <p>Unix, BSD families and Linux, all start with few TUIs and everything else, just commands in a white/black/blue background. Naturally, if you going to work a lot in the terminal, you may like to use <b>screen</b> and <b>tmux</b> to manage all necessary "windows" to do what you are working, while with that, you may wish to have some <b>Graphical</b> interface to have much more space to organize everything, like having 300 terminal windows running different processes. Is funny that the author of <b>X server</b>, the application that enable Graphical interfaces, <b>Xorg</b> don't maintain the project for years, which is bad in a security perspective. Then the Xlibre was forked from <b>X server</b> and this days is a active maintained project, that is not stucked in Time... </p>
      <p>OpenBSD did develop his own X-server-fork, years before. I Really like that. Is one of the aspects that I think OpenBSD, to be that operating system that did try to create something new. I mean, I don't know if FreeBSD did develop a fork of X or all others BSD brothers and sisters, but what is true is that, all others, use X, even if Xlibre will be enable in FreeBSD, is what the news say.</p>
      <p>Is better that you read about this story, since I only share some clues about it. I think is about that old problem, that is about knowledge and the possession of it, as being unique and superior. Is an attitude, many times seen by Economic and Commercial systems, that have some difficulty to assume, what is true. </p>
      <p>There is no superiority in anyone, when the objective is demonstrating it. I mean, Redhat-Linux use it for commercial proposes, while the project was developed without a economic input, that motivates that development. So, in that aspect, the author can be "happy" if some amount of money goes into his pocket, or "sad", since there is no money and some commercial groups are getting money from it. Make sense to me. </p>
      <p>This is how humanity is "growing", creating "corruption" in the name of "someone else idea", in a economic system that is possible to make that exchange, that can be desired by others. In this aspect, of sharing something useful to the user, and by explaining what it or what is not, I cannot deny that, commercial groups are doing something good, while is true, that some groups like this ones, have that "propose in life" that make them do, choices, that for some persons are good and for others, can be or not, but it always something, if you follow the pattern of information between each, since is an effect of imagination. What each-person can reach about each-subject/object, which create within the brain? What possibilties each-person can see?</p>
      <p>Anyway, I cannot say that the mouse is bad. Like GUIs that simplify actions, and like mouses that simplify options-location-in-screens, the <a href="./blog/awesome//files//Security/Offensive/AR.html">rats</a> eating and doing business with everything they can...</p>
      <p>Maybe we can objecify all business as Rats, in the commercial perspective, is a way to reach others that are "not paying attention to what the coders are doing" but see utility in what ever product is they offer. Is fair, for the commercial group, while commercial groups are rarely fair with the author of any product. Is a older issue in fact. I remember those movies about some Kung Fu master, that teach all students and one day, one of them, wish to fight against the master to show him self, superior. </p>
      <p>I don't know if this kind of behavior existed in Kung Fu history in China, but the point is... To understand each one function as a contribution to the creation of anything, while in the process, others fight against, creating a new possibility with it, like any organic system would do. So at the end, is only <b>that</b> process of <b>Trans</b>formation. Some call it, Evolution. I don't know, but sometimes we may think that "humanity" is against evolution, while they are only "stucked in Time", or maybe just forgot what ever they had in Mind. Objectives change too. So, don't get bad with that, is part of our organic way to create. </p>
