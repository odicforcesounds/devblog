      <p>The American are redirected to the Statue of Freedon, Indian to some of their Favorite Gods, the Chinese to "Sun Wukong" wikipedia, the Japanese to "Something similar", and when I don't know which symbols are part of their culture, I redirect their IPs to the Wikipedia of their Countries, like for example Singapore, Irland, and others.</p>
      <p>Since by logic (without using external proxies, each user have more or less 5 ips that can be used by them, when this users already use all theses IPs, they will be unable to reach my site again.</p>
      <p>If I cannot solve this problem of being <a href="./excitedMoments.html">excited</a> when attacking me, the limitations of reality will do that for me.</p>
      <p>The process of changing your IP is by turning OFF internet, wait some hours and connect again. :D </p>
