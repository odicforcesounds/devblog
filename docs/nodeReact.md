# NodeJS & ReactJS

After reading almost 100.000 books ( articles ) about ReactJS and NodeJS, I finally found that I need to use both. 

NodeJS is made to Backend communications, like files or databases. 

ReactJS is made to improve the Frontend, like the UI and Page-Behavior. 

While I am developing the STK ( Social Tool Kit ) from the main website of odicforcesounds.com domain with ReactNative, I found that I don't need to learn more than this two "Frameworks". 

I mean, NodeJS is not a Framework, but JavaScript for Machines ( outside the Browser ), while ReactJS is a Framework based on JavaScript. 

I really like the MongoDB aka NoSQL data structure style. It looks super simple, compared to MySQL or PostgreeSQL, while using external services like Firebase or Supabase is an optional choice. 

Yes, I think I will use my old-machine (laptop) to store the data of both applications. The STK application and the Bookstore that I need to build to start selling some books. [In reference of the last post] 

Is some perspectives I hate ReactJS, since I **LOVE** static websites with static **HTML** and **CSS**, like all my sites are. 

But I need to force me to improve my skills and embrace the Future. 

So, I think I will start to write a bit more in my [Developing Blog](macacopreguicoso.blogspot.com) to guide me to understand small / big details of both. 

Is not a contradictory afirmation. Small details can result in Big results. Is like making a SpaceTrip to the Moon. If a Small details fails, can result in a Big failure, like a big big Explosion. 

While the Big is as well, the result of several pieces that are small, while together make one single piece that is Big. 

Is like me and you. Your body is the Big result of many small pieces that together make the whole of what is on you. 

If a small fragment of you fail, all other pieces from you will fail too. 

As I like to say: "I am just a Monkey and all Monkeys are noisy, as they warn about the danger, while being peaceful animals". 

Don't try to hurt me. The Bigs are watching to prevent that event. And if it happen, the Big will become so Crazhy that you will wish to stop them, but the only condition to stop them is on me. 

So, Lets me do what I need to, and enjoy Your life as you should. Keep Rocking and Enjoy the Show!
