      <p>Domain name registrations is possible to everyone, and with that in mind, anyone can create a website to share a public or private blog, a company service, a social-network, etc. In my experience, there are many users that don't investigate website information because trying to attack the website, which is a bit stupid, because this information can give you more details about the author, or not, depending on the services that this user pay for, as the main configuration information of their website. </p>
      <p>A very old popular Terminal Application, is by using <b>whois</b> command, to see all the information of a website. For example, if you do <b>whois odicforcesounds.com</b> you will find the creation date, the actual year validation, the registration validation date, the DNS services used and sometimes you can find the personal information of the user, which in this case is private. But many other domains, have the actual address and name of the owner of that domain. Deeper, you can see the IPs of the hosting of this website using the <b>dig</b> command. Here, you can see where the code of the site is hosted and with that in mind, investigate futher. Even if you read what is exposed in this website, you will find the actual Github Repository, that is open to new pull-requests, issues or comments.</p>
      <p>To actual companies, this tools are very handy, to validate or investigate each domain, and company details. Sometimes we have a list of email that can be used for contact proposes or malicious proposes. That depends on each, since the information is exposed.</p>
