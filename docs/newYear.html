    <p>Tonight was like yesterday, and tomorow will like yesterday, at least for me. My Birthday is not today and
      therefor I don't celebrate a new Year. </p>
    <p>For Time, in Time, a New Year is bigger than 106070 Years, but for me is just my own age, while today is not my
      Birthday..</p>
    <p>What a strange way to celebrate the new year, like WARS, explosions everywhere, making peaceful animals to run
      away in any direction, losts and in fear. </p>
    <p>What the HELL is happening? (ask all peaceful animals that understand that something strange is happening)</p>
    <p>The Culture of Wars, always desire to see colors in the sky that are not natural colors. </p>
