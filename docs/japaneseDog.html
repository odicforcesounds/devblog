      <p>Just another awesome user that is following me, while I am not so awesome as "he".</p>
      <p>I am a Monkey and he is a Dog. While exploring <a href="https://github.com/XiaomingX" target="_blank">his</a> profile, I find that he is probably a Security researcher, and if that is true, I feel good to have him with me. Is what Dogs do in real life, they do some security research, even if, they didn't study for that, because is a natural gift, they have.</p>
      <p>I thought he was Japanese, since is what his profile say he is, while his site, points to be Chinese. Putting away the original source of Japan, even if sometimes they don't like what I am going to express, I cannot lie to myself. Japan and China are like those brothers that born from the same mother, but Japan sister (China) have some problems to forget what happen, 40 centuries ago, before Christ. Their mother is not proud to see her sons, fighting and competing, but she understand the nature of each. </p>
      <h2 class="title3">Obcessive and Compulsive problems with Perfeccionism</h2>.
      </p> <p>Is what Dragons are made. Within a strict discipline that ask them to be better every single day, while they dislike to see those who are not so perfect as they are, while being permissive with Monkeys, as the ones who can do, silly jokes, logic mistakes and being offensive.</p>

      <p>Like all theories, they can be true or false,  since everything in this life, depends on "how we see it", while the "we", is about "each". This theory about Chinese Zodiacs can be true or false, but since I am a Monkey, I am testing it in reality, since by the same theory, I am the only one who can do it.</p>
