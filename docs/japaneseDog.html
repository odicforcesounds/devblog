      <p>Just another awesome user that is following me, while I am not so awesome as "he".</p>
      <p>I am Monkey and he is a Dog. While exploring <a href="https://github.com/XiaomingX" target="_blank">his</a> profile, I find that he is probably a Security researcher, and if that is true, I feel good to have him with me. Is what Dogs do in real life, they do some security research, even if, they didn't study for that, because is a natural gift, they have.</p>
