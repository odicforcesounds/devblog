      <p>I have no appreciation to see Gay Porn, but I don't fight against, since for that, I would be giving strength to what I don't wish to give strength. I feel like Chinese and Japanese don't like my sites, and I am fine with it. I can go into Cloudflare settings and BAN China and Japan, and all of them, will not see what they can ignore. They speak so much about Daoismo, and it looks they didn't learn anything about it. Just by pointing your mind to something else, what is ugly lose importance. I don't like to see China and Japan ready for wars, like I dislike the same attitude from USA, Israel, Palestine, Ukraine, Russia and others. What I do? I ignore them. Like <a href="./tryingToFixJustice.html">Children</a> You behave, but worst, since children don't kill each others for something futil, and in fact, children don't kill each others in any way. So You are all Worst than Children, if in some moments of our lifes, children could be bad at all. They only made mistakes. Irrelevant mistakes, not like you, that you should know how to think. I am fine with that. You keep in your country, block all other contries ( like you did in your lovely history ) and I can continue in peace, sharing with children, this problems from history. Let me guess: you like to punish children to demonstrate yourself strong and powerful? Looks funny, but I really think that it is a bad joke. Monkey jokes, like children jokes are not bad, since they are playing without the intention to create what goes in their minds. So, this is not a joke from children or from monkeys. I guess is your humor that create that joke for yourself. </p>
      <p>Or maybe you dislike to read that publication that say that "the <a href="./superiorGender.html">Superior</a> Gender is Woman". Oh did I break your heart? Oh.. Don't cry, you can try all your life to give birth your superior genders from the Anus of your lovers. There is no doubt, about that desire to have many Men or Robots, Soldier Robots, since Man are Mortal. (if robots know the difference or learn(like you did) the difference, maybe is a good solution. You can create wars outside this planet, for all the reasons you desire to fight, and all humans can keep doing music, being creative and you can take all the creepy shity weapons that you create in history, to outside this planet, and we have a "little historical problem solved, with Robots, while a <b>doubt</b> it that, that <b>morality</b> prevails in Time. <code>Show me I will be Wrong for All Eternity!!! Show me!!! </code> <br> You could create Robots that look like woman, but your choice was to create robots that look like man. Is that choice a sexual admiration? Oh you become racist... OK.. you embrace the Storm without the ability to leave it away.. So, once again, you didn't learn anything from your history. Just repeating right? Have fun, but let all others live in peace. If you feel bad, kill yourself and solve the problem. Because, I could understand your rejection against me, if I was American, but is not the case. Maybe our history with more than 600 years, is part of the past. A past that we don't wish to remember and therefor you see my attitude as something bad. So, why did you keep remembering what you see as bad? If you burn all, all your history is vanish from Human History and nothing can be remembered again. Is like those "Nazi" thoughts against the world, without thinking about the propose of books, since <b>books</b> are not bad or good, but who is able to create good or bad, is in those who have Free Will of Choice, and therefor, by your condition of Choice, all depends on your knowledge and <b>how much you take the content seriously</b>, is what can create the bad or the good that exist on us. The more serious you are when reading any subject, the more you are able to create in reality, the content of the book, even more, when you don't question the content of the book. The book can describe something like: "Monkey don't like man" and the reader who fall in love with the <a href="https://book.odicforcesounds.com">Monkey Book</a>, feel the need to treat bad man, just because the <a href="./style_of_god.html">Book</a> express into that direction, if you <i>fall in love with the content</i>. Is what we call as <b>Irracionality from those who are able to Think</b>. </p>
      <p>Does humanity think? Few did, and those discover something and learn many other things, and with it, create new things. Many others didn't, and those try to destroy almost everything. So the question is made by this little audio-track: Are You Evil ??? I am sure you can be, while for all eternity, will depend on your choice.. I can only try to guide, since is my only propose in life. </p>
      <p>Never read much about Daoism, but sometimes I feel I can understand it, since is all about what I like most in life, which is music, melody, vibrations, sensations to "explore" my ability to dream and with it, create something. After all, all the process of imagination in the state of appreciation, was a learning process. Can be another melody, can be a simple text tree. Like the <a href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Dao/index.html">Dao</a> Poem is.</p>
