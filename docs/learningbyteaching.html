      <p>How does someone imagine the product he/she wish to see in reality as a function or utility that is possibly useful?</p>
      <p>That is the first question that each may wish to create within it's mind, to "walk the path" of creating the dreams in reality.</p>
      <p>With Programming Languages we can develop all kind of "illusions" in this world, that behave faster than we can imagine, while being a copy of what each individual can be.</p>
      <p>Computers is their Common Names, while like humans do with all and everything, they personalize what is common to make it original, just by changing small pieces of the copy. Is in that aspect, that the right to copy, in the actual legal documents that guide humans choices, are completly stupid, since is impossible to create something so original that have no source of inspiration of another copy of the same product with different names.</p>
      <p>Anyway, <a target="_blank" "https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/tracks/11_Social_Tool_Kit/index.html">this</a> text that explain in a "funny" way, the application I am about to publicate, did change a lot, since I am not Rich and I cannot suport the dream. But, the intention and the functionality is there, present. Users probably will ignore the features that are close to what is described in this <a href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Spiritual_Algorithmic/tracks/01_The_Challenge/index.html" target="_blank">other</a> text that describe the dream in a rational style. Most of those features that you can read there, will not be implemented, but the main intention, will be present. The same propose.</p>
      <p>Like many of parents and grandparents say, the most important is to follow the vision. So we try to build that small dream, without know nothing about the results of it.</p>
      <p>In my mind, there is only the "functional" details that I wish to implement in this application, but to describe that for developers, sometimes can be a bit crazy, mainly because it looks that they only care about the UI, while for me, is only option to select and create what is suposed to do, not how it looks, while I like to be "out of the box" and with that, create uncommon views, but here the problem was mainly, poor skills of communication. These developers are having a good pacience with me, and communication is not the best, since they like to organize themselfs within video-meetings, while I do organize better myself, by writting or reading. I had this little problem with them, that they will learn to fix, but you know, is good to understand what is not working, to create solutions to make it work. After some weeks, I decide to create a documment to describe all the details with all new fixes and changes, since the main ideas that are described above cannot be done, I need to create something "new" almost forcing an improvisation, which is a good skill I have. So, it was not difficult to me, to create new variables and new conditons, and to imagine more or less the same without being the same, but it is the same. :) Almost like the DaoDeJing poems describe, what it is without being. </p>
      <p>I really think that, developer groups should add access to documents, where creators can describe the creation and with that in mind, create the product. Within this document, is expected that developers create a list of objectives and describe the changes in text format before uploading the changes to the test environment. Is about Logic, since this group of developers, just did ignore what I ask them to to, which is, describe the changes in text before sharing with me, all changes that were made by them, I could verify that, those changes described in text format, are the ones I need to validate, since the list of changes, can list all the changes that didn't change. </p>
      <p>As a guy who is expecting results without knowing what change were made, I got a bit offensive, but hopefully they understand, that small detail, where Monkeys are like Children and they react what they think is wrong. Since they start sending me videos with changes that were not made, I got  a bit more offensive. :) People can become offensive because, something is wrong and even if the answer is logic and clear, some people don't wait a few seconds to think about what they are doing. We learn from mistakes and no one can live without doing mistakes, even if they try to not. <br>
      Mistakes are Important! Lets Celebrate Mistakes all over the world. Celebrate others mistakes. Show them your own and have a big dinner with a lot of Fun!</p>
