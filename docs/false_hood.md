# The False Hood

That sense of truthness being false. 

Is like Solipsism on reverse. 

The numbers of "visits" from Hong Kong, Japan and others from the last [review](./domain_statistics.md), are false. :'(

The Dragon doesn't care about it. Naturally, how could I reach the Dragon? 

Maybe they see it offensive, while Chinese cultures say the same about Monkeys. 

What issue they see in me that exist on them?

Me imagining of having thousen of visits and all those inputs where just [attacks](./mar.md)

:-)
