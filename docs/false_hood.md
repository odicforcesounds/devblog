# The False Hood

That sense of truthness being false. 

Is like Solipsism on reverse. 

The numbers of "visits" from Hong Kong, Japan and others from the last [review](./domain_statistics.md), are false. :'(

The Dragon doesn't care about it. Naturally, how could I reach the Dragon? 

Maybe they see it offensive, while Chinese cultures say the same about Monkeys. 

What issue they see in me that exist on them?

While both use some cultural values that are the same, from somewhere in History.

I think Portugal and China or Japan had good relationships in the past.

That is what I read. Maybe is a misinformation.
