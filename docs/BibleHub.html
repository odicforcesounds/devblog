      <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/q/why_commit_atrocities_in_god's_name.htm" target="_blank">BibleHub</a> is a nice site that we can read about many subjects related to the Bible and other subjects associated. For example in the link above, we can read about the atrocities that the Church did in History, while the texts try to reject any responsability from the Church, there are some moments that we can say: "Ok, the Churck is accepting the Evil the Church did, and by this they try to change their position in the subject". (which is good) </p>
      <p>As explained in <a href="./theGoodOnChristianity.html">this</a> article, 400 years after Jesus Christ, the Church accept to be represented by those who refuse and deny Jesus Christ Teachings. If we accept that the Church was manipulated by Constantine, we can think that the Church is like the "Monkey who doesn't See, Evil" and therefor, accepted to be ruled by the one who bring Evil, mainly when the big objective was Church Victory. Non-Healthy competitions already exist 4 centuries after Christ. Maybe the original way to <a href="./strangeCelebrations.html">Remember</a> Jesus Christ, was not the same used these days, but if we assume that a Nordic Pagan who Love wars manipulate the Church at all levels, then it looks normal that Christians celebrate the Death of the ones they love, while that, demonstrate how blind Christianity was all this time.</p>
      <p>Is like the Texts that inspire AlQuran. The Sacred book was not written by the Mohamed, but by some other people that was inspired by those texts, creating something that the auhor probably don't agree, but since the <a href="./MuslinLaws.html">Muslin</a> was a big group of people that were slaves for many others, before Christ, the book was made to give continuity to that system of enslavements, described in the AlQuran as something sacred.. </p>
      <p>This is like a training for Pros. We speak about what happen as Wrong to improve the present of what can be Right, but would be Stupid to talk only about the good, ignoring the Bad: <a href="./denyEvilLearning.html">The 3 Wise Monkeys</a> Teachments, and how good and how bad, ignoring what is Evil can be. For example, the Church ignore the Evil of Constantine and become the Image of that Evilness in Church Image, as part of the Church it self. By accepting someone to be Baptized, doesn't make those persons good and God will not forgive them for the Evil they did, but the Church acccept them, to gain more followers. (and once again, the Church become to all others, what the Church accept to be to others - The Salvation of their <a href="./questionOrders.html">Sins</a> ). Therefor the Church become what they accept to be represented by. There is a popular saying that describe: Tell me with Who you are and I tell you who you are. So, if the majority of Christian believers are just Criminal that are trying to find salvation, the Church become Criminal, by accepting them, without their will to become better and be sorry for their Sins. Because the only way to be saved is by the conscience that understand they made something wrong and they will not repeat it again. Else, is not salvation, but manipulation and Corruption. You know children. They can do something wrong, but we assume that they will not repeat, because they regret their actions. Else, they cannot be saved.</p>
      <p>All Criminal Groups dream about a Religion like this: We kill and the God forgive, just because we are "Christians". The Italian Mafias for years, did believe on this. So like some movies describe, they kill and "pray" for forgiveness after the killing. Is this a Joke? No it is reality. Like <a href="./amazingUSA.html">USA</a> say after sharing news about more wars they are in. "God Bless America". O_o (God Did Bless All by Giving them the experience of being Alive with Conscience of their Choices)</p>
      <p>For example: The actual days in Brazil, the Indigenous people need to convert themself to Christianity to get support from the Church. They continue to do this Evil conversion as a necessary step to give support to someone who need help, without having to change their beliefs in the name of that fragility they are in. </p>
