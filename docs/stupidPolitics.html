      <p>Some experimental meeting was done to accomplish one mission. The mission was to build up a house. Two different groups that have different skills and different thinking, styles and many other things, different from each others, inside or outside the same group, are about to work together. </p>
      <p>So they start working all days for more than 6 months to build this house, from the foundation until the roof, electricity, water, sound proof, security and keys for the doors.</p>
      <p>Congratulation, you have done your objective. Today you can go home or party with us, to celebrate your successful work. After a few hours, two single persons start to have a "hot" conversation about <a href="./PoliticalLoveLesson.html">Politics</a>, which bring others to pay attention to that conversation. Since this conversation was not so "hot" as sex, what could happen could not have a happy end.  </p>
      <p>Like all popular stories, one of them try to hit the other and by that sequence, many try to defend others, which did result in a big fight between many. The results are simple. They were able to build a house and work together, but they were unable to discuss political subject's without fighting.</p>
      <p>Conclusion: Politics are made of <b>Words</b> and <b>Words don't change reality</b> 
      There are many things that change reality, which is your work. 
      If you don't know how to deal with being wrong 
      You will never be able to make Politics something useful. 
      Not even the polititions, since the objective is to work in concrete objectives. 
      On discussions, you can only change your mind, and become closer to what you discuss with. 
      In a condition were two persons with two different interpretations 
      Did develop Excelent Self Discipline when discussing anything
      If a Fascist pass his life discussing Politics with a Communism, 
      The probability is that the Fascist start seeing something good in Communism 
      And the Communist start seeing something good in Fascism. 
      And If they don't change the way each think about the other, 
      They can understand how to work and communicate better with the other 
      Without fighting for a position to demonstrate Superiority 
      But Only Respect. 
      </p>
      <p>I don't know about you, but my mother sometimes was fascist with me and some other times communist with me. I have a political Relationship with my mother and father, and therefor I need to discuss with them, to make them understand my choices and to be possible to live together without passing our life fighting for something that is pure Subjective. (Not Even Words Are, but thougths that feed our Imagination to help us to build a "image") that it is only inside each one mind, while knowing that is helpful, because then you know that whatever each one have in mind, need to be exposed and explained in details, before trying to discuss any detail. </p>
      <p class="center">Some statistics demonstrate that for example, police that fight narcotraffic, become narcotraffic. </p>
      <p class="center">Who may try to fight against, may become what it is fighting without thinking about a solution. </p>
