<h1 id="somewhere-in-time">Somewhere in Time</h1>
<p>A child was born within a family that talk about religions and
filosophy. <br> This child had no obligation to have a religion, since
the majority of the conversations at home, where about the concepts
behind each. <br> Somewhere in Time, when this child was already men,
had a experience, as some “electrical package” fall from the sky into
his head, and from that moment on, he dedicate his life to this sites
<br></p>
<p>I like Taoism. <br> I like to see the Creativity, that is in You and
in me. <br> I like the human ability to Imagine and to Create<br>
Sometimes I don’t like, what humans do with their
<strong>Unique</strong> and <strong>Divine</strong> characteristic that
all have.<br> Without it, nothing would ever change, nothing could ever
be created.<br></p>
<h2 id="i-am-human-too">I am Human Too</h2>
<p>Humans can only learn by doing mistakes?<br> Humans can learn by
reading, while the thinker will not do anything with what the thinker
knows.<br> In this world, we can teach to give the opportunity to
others, to become better.<br> Many prefer to Judge, when they could
teach.<br> Many children were target of violent penalties, for doing
something wrong.<br> What Should I do when non-children do mistakes?<br>
I dont’ know, but I keep trying to Teach.<br></p>
<h2 id="my-style">My Style</h2>
<p>My style is to create creative content, while trying to teach.<br> I
am not a teacher and my composition is not made of letters.<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Everything I describe is my sites, are about <strong>The Style of
God</strong>, while the Style is not God.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yin-yang-teaching">Yin Yang teaching</h2>
<p>The beauty of contradictions of Yin and Yang, associated to God and
the Devil.<br> One day a “Good Men” create something.<br> In the next
day a “Bad Men”, deny the “Good Men” creation.<br> The “Good”, become
bad, because did react in a violent way, against who deny his will.<br>
The “Bad” become good, because it was victimized in a vilent way, by who
should know how to deal with those who deny.</p>
<ul>
<li>This days, we can see so many stories like this.
<ul>
<li>People reacting in a violent way, to those who deny their will.</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="cultural-interpretations">Cultural Interpretations</h2>
<p>In Chinese interpretation, Monkeys can be offensive, while they are
peaceful.<br> Outside China, many are silent, while demonstrating being
destructive.<br> Maybe is a coincidence, because Chinese can be silent,
while demonstrating being in Peace.</p>
<h2 id="the-majority-of-justice-systems">The Majority of Justice
Systems</h2>
<p><strong>Everything you will say, can be used against you in
Court.</strong><br></p>
<ul>
<li>The Criminals believe in the same, but they don’t make of use of
Courts.
<ul>
<li>This is the common aspect between Legal-Justice and
Illegal-Justice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The only way to do Justice, is to be Evil.
<ul>
<li>Else, we can only teach, to change the choice of those who make
wrong choices,</li>
<li>while doing the wrong choices, lead us to learn fast.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="military-and-god-in-history">Military and God in History</h2>
<p>I don’t like the military, when the objective is destructive.<br>
They learn to accept orders, without questioning them.<br> They cannot
deny them, or else, they will be punished.<br> I don’t know who love
those systems, but I see that many do.<br> Maybe God is there, trying to
be happy with those who don’t deny his will.<br></p>
<ul>
<li>God is Good but kill us all, the Devil is Bad but make us Laugth.
<ul>
<li>I am sure that the “Devil” is the Guardian of Paradise.</li>
<li>The one who knows, who is Good or Bad, because God can be Mad.</li>

<h2 id="books-and-god-in-history">Books and God in History</h2>
<p>All Religious books are like books-for-children.<br></p>
<ul>
<li>They try to teach some basic values.</li>
<li>They try to inform you about humans events.
<ul>
<li>Sadly many readers, don’t think about what they read.</li>
<li>Sadly, most known religious books, become like “technical
books”</li>
<li>People believe that what those books describe is God will,</li>
<li>but for everything that Human create, is Human will, not God.</li>
<li>God cannot write books, humans can.</li>

<li>At the end, we have 5 different descriptions of the same paint.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How many paints are in this room?
<ul>
<li>So many books that describe God.</li>
<li>So many groups compiting about which Book is True.</li>
<li>So many groups denying others interpretations of the same “object”.
<ul>
<li>Maybe they don’t wish to learn, while they love to compite.</li>
</ul></li>

the mind.</li>

<p>What contradicts with Pleasure?<br> <strong>Love</strong>: “If you

Happiness.”</p>
<ul>
<li>To those who have children and Love them, how many sacrifices you
need to do?</li>
<li>I am sure that those sacrifices, did not give you Pleasure.
<ul>
<li>Love ask dedication, persistence,</li>
<li>we need to deny what we wish for us,</li>
<li>to make the ones we love, happy.</li>
<li>And if you make them happy, you will feel happy.</li>
<li>Only in that moment, you feel pleasure.
<ul>
<li>Because the ones you love are good, not because you had an
orgasm.</li>
