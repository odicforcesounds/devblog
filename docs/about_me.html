<h1 class="title1">Somewhere in Time</h1>
<p>A child was born within a family that talk about religions and
filosophy. <br> This child had no obligation to have a religion, since
the majority of the conversations at home, where about the concepts
behind each. <br> Somewhere in Time, when this child was already men,
had a experience, as some “electrical package” fall from the sky into
his head, and from that moment on, he dedicate his life to this sites
<br></p>
<p>I like Taoism. <br> I like to see the Creativity, that is in You and
in me. <br> I like the human ability to Imagine and to Create<br>
Sometimes I don’t like, what humans do with their
<strong>Unique</strong> and <strong>Divine</strong> characteristic that
all have.<br> Without it, nothing would ever change, nothing could ever
be created.<br></p>
<h2 class="title1">I am Human Too</h2>
<p>Humans can only learn by doing mistakes?<br> Humans can learn by
reading, while the thinker will not do anything with what the thinker
knows.<br> In this world, we can teach to give the opportunity to
others, to become better.<br> Many prefer to Judge, when they could
teach.<br> Many children were target of violent penalties, for doing
something wrong.<br> What Should I do when non-children do mistakes?<br>
I dont’ know, but I keep trying to Teach.<br></p>
<h2 class="my-style">My Style</h2>
<p>My style is to create creative content, while trying to teach.<br> I
am not a teacher and my composition is not made of letters.<br></p>
<ul class="itemList">

God</strong>, while the Style is not God.</li>

<h2 class="itemList">Yin Yang teaching</h2>
<p>The beauty of contradictions of Yin and Yang, associated to God and
the Devil.<br> One day a “Good Men” create something.<br> In the next
day a “Bad Men”, deny the “Good Men” creation.<br> The “Good”, become
bad, because did react in a violent way, against who deny his will.<br>
The “Bad” become good, because it was victimized in a vilent way, by who
should know how to deal with those who deny.</p>
<ul class="itemList">
<li class="bPostItem">This days, we can see so many stories like this.

</ul>
<h2 class="itemList">Cultural Interpretations</h2>
<p>In Chinese interpretation, Monkeys can be offensive, while they are
peaceful.<br> Outside China, many are silent, while demonstrating being
destructive.<br> Maybe is a coincidence, because Chinese can be silent,
while demonstrating being in Peace.</p>

<h2 class="itemList">Military and God in History</h2>
<p>I don’t like the military, when the objective is destructive.<br>
They learn to accept orders, without questioning them.<br> They cannot
deny them, or else, they will be punished.<br> I don’t know who love
those systems, but I see that many do.<br> Maybe God is there, trying to
be happy with those who don’t deny his will.<br></p>
