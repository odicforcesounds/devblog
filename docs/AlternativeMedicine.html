      <p>Well, the Tradicional Medicine demonstrate a lot of knowledge that have a lot of symbology too, while in the Modern Medicine, symbols are only chemical values that are more scientific. Whatever is the approach to care someone else health, the traditional add some extra points in the process of taking care the problem of the person, while Modern Medicine just add some pill and don't give any extra steps, to do in the process of restoring a health problem..</p>
      <p>Is like this Controversial idea where the Modern Medicine are made by "Psychopaths" and Tradicional Medicine by "Sadistic". This words are in "Quote", because they don't mean to mean what they mean. You go into some hospital in the Urgencies and you can see, how Modern Medicine "needs to be a bit Psychopath", because they will not care how much pain you feel and they need your information to understand what is happening to you, like they are not very sensible to others, in a inability to find what is wrong with the patience without making too much questions, since after all, you going to take some pills or you going to the Operatory Room, with an Extra Injection to remove all possible Pain from you. </p>
      <p>Int the other hand, the Tradicional Medicine, they looks a bit "Sadistic", since they will ask you to make specific exercises that will cause you some pain, which was the technique used in the (palpation) process to find the source of the pain of someone else. Some of them are so sensible to how others can be, that just by looking without making any questions, they already point to some truth about your health problems. The "sadistic" in only in  that painful process that can be acupunture, massages and other techniques to move and correct your bones alightment, muscules and others without taking any pill, which process can be painful but with awesome results, with more resistence to create prevention..</p>
      <p>All hospitals can improve by mixing both knowledges, in case the professionals are passionated about the subject they do. That internal Passion needs to be almost genuine to be sure that each professional will try to be the best version of everything they know, plus their sensitivity to interpret the world (the body) before asking something to the patience.</p>
      <p>for Example: A few days ago I went to the <a href="./pharmacDrugs.html">Hospital</a> for my foot pain. They make a radiography to the foot and since nothing was broken, pill were given to calm down the problem and calm down the pain. If you see any Traditional Medicine topic, mainly the Chinese, Your pain can be reflected in the food but the source of the pain be your back (Spine). You know as well that Cold days, will crack all musculature of any body. So, is like asking help to someone that looks like "it does know how to treat you, but at least did solve your main problem faster, which was the pain itself. The traditional medicine, looks like someone that knows how to find and treat the source of your problem, but assume that you will feel some pain.</p>
