      <p>OpenBSD documentation is not bad, but could be better. In any case, OpenBSD site, could make reference of other domains that have Good information which can help OpenBSD users. Reading the manual is what each can do, while the complexity to prepare a machine with all details that are needed to configure specific needs, are not always described, which lead us to do more mistakes.</p>
      <p>Doing mistakes is the way we can learn, but having a good source of information is better.</p>
      <p>Maybe I didn't read correctly or maybe there is no example at all in OpenBSD documentation, but I found some cool sites that are helping me to understand better how to setup a OpenBSD as a Firewall / Router.</p>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://openbsdrouterguide.net/">This</a> site build in a old fashion way, is everything I wish to see in OpenBSD site, while the source don't share any link to explore this one. I think that OpenBSD site could become better, just by linking all other sources that are good. And when I say "good", I mean organized and updated. Another <b>awesome</b> sources are: <a target="_blank" href="https://btxx.org/posts/openbsd-router/">this</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vedetta-com/vedetta">this</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://markshroyer.com/guides/router/index.html">this</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://markshroyer.com/guides/router/index.html">this</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2024-12-07-building-an-ipv6-focused-openbsd-home-router/">this</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://0xc45.com/blog/openbsd-home-router/">this</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://subnets.ru/HOWTO/pf_example.html">this</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/pf/">this</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://srobb.net/pf.html">this</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://fatsquirrel.org/veghead/wot/openbsd25.html">this</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://home.nuug.no/~peter/pf/en/index.html">this</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://calomel.org/pf_config.html">this</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andreasbaumann/openbsd-firewall">this</a> last one, updated for all this years.</p>
