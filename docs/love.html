      <!--       BODY -->
      <p>Love is not about kisses and sex. Love is not about feeling Good and reject to deal with what we don't like. Love is not something easy to do and is not funny at all. Imagine that you are preparing some meal. If you don't care about how the meal will be cooked, you just put the food on fire and wait to be cooked. You didn't care to prepare the food, you didn't care to put the necessary ingredients in the correct moment, you didn't care how it looks. You just cook and whatever the result is, is what you going to eat.</p>
      <p>But that is not cooking with care and therefor, that have no Love from you. Love is hard and Love ask sacrifice of your Time, you may wish to reject your desires, what make you feel good and probably ask you to embrace some painful experience, like any good work ask to anyone. Love is that time dedication where you refuse to enjoy what you like, to make others life better. Love is that attention that create something unique, because you did care to present the final product in a way that anyone feel the desire to have, just because it looks good to your eyes, or to your nose.</p>
      <p>When you work hard to make something good, not only for you but to someone else or to many other selfs, you will feel satisfied and others will see on you, the reflection of the product you made, or the actions you did create, not for money but for that sensation that you are satisfied with all details of that product as result of your time sacrifice, that create the unicity that no one can deny. That is what Love is.</p>
      <p>When people say: "Love Yourself", is not to kiss yourself and to eat sweets until you get fat. To Love yourself is to deny what satisfy your sold in a fast way, is to work hard on the Gym, to studie what you need, refusing to go to parties to have fun, and be at home, reading and repeating some boring exercises that you need to practice to be better on that specific subject.</p>
      <p>The ones that become good, didn't went to parties all nights. Some of them didn't have an opportunity to find the partener they could have, if they could dedicate time on that objective. But their objective is not to find some partener, but to be better on some subject, that is not only "how it looks", but how does make us feel. In this aspect, your partener should make you feel special and to feel special, it doesn't matter how it looks. Sometimes the ones who love us are hard with us, because they care about us. I always think about my parents. They were cool (sometimes) and not cool at all many other times. If you try to find someone for you that is always cool, you are lying to yourself, because the one who love you, will be explicit on everthing they believe that you need to listen. </p>
