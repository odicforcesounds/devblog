      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti-ZEWPtYxI">Here</a> is another cool project that I like to listen about. The Mesh networks in Europe where part of some Anarchy activity to create that solution to many communities. I guess in Spain there is a lot of communities that use Mesh networks, for the community, aways from corporations that only desire to exploits others informations and rape them off. The process this guys are trying to implement, is hard, since the users are not always open to learn about technologies since they present to be a bit difficult, and their lifes is already difficult, that they see any other difficult challenge, as something to avoid. So yeah, I agree that developers should know how to teach new users, but not only that, they adapt software to users needs, puting away all the pornography that comercial groups use against their users, like for example, the popular exmple that is selling users information to someone you don't know what is their intentions. You know, in the world of money, you are part of the system that can make money grow, so you are not a important piece of that game, you are just another customer that can make money grow. Are you happy with our services? That is what most important each service can have. Therefor You trust their choice right? Since is about your data, not their. :)  </p>
