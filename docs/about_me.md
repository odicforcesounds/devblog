# Somewhere in Time 

A child was born within a family that talk about religions and filosophy. <br>
This child had no obligation to have a religion, since the majority of the conversations at home, where about the concepts behind each. <br>
Somewhere in Time, when this child was already men, had a experience that make him embrace the idea of Taoism. <br>

I like Taoism. <br>	
I like to see the Creativity, that is in You and in me. <br>
I like the human ability to Imagine and to Create<br>
Sometimes I don't like, what humans do with their Unique Divine characteristics that all have.<br>
Without it, nothing would ever change, nothing could ever be created.<br>

## I am Human Too

Humans can only learn by doing mistakes?<br>
Humans can learn by reading, while the thinker will not do anything with what the thinker knows.<br>
In this world, we can teach to give the opportunity to others, to become better.<br>
Many prefer to Judge, when they could teach.<br>
Many children were target of violent penalties, for doing something wrong.<br>
What Should I do when non-children do mistakes?<br>
I dont' know, but I keep trying to Teach.<br>

## My Style 

My style is to create creative content, while trying to teach.<br>
I am not a teacher and my composition is not made of letters.<br>

- Everything I describe is my sites, are about **The Style of God**, while the Style is not God.

## Yin Yang teaching 

The beauty of contradictions of Yin and Yang, associated to God and the Devil.<br>
One day a "Good Men" create something.<br>
In the next day a "Bad Men", deny the "Good Men" creation.<br>
The "Good", become bad, because did react in a violent way, against who deny his will.<br>
The "Bad" become good, because it was victimized in a vilent way, by who should know how to deal with those who deny.

- This days, we can see so many stories like this.
    - People reacting in a violent way, to those who deny their will.

## Cultural Interpretations 

In Chinese interpretation, Monkeys can be offensive, while they are peaceful.<br>
Outside China, many are silent, while demonstrating being destructive.<br>
Maybe is a coincidence, because Chinese can be silent, while demonstrating being in Peace.

## The Majority of Justice Systems 

**Everything you will say, can be used against you in Court.**<br>

- The Criminals believe in the same, but they don't make of use of Courts.
    - This is the common aspect between Legal-Justice and Illegal-Justice.
- The only way to do Justice, is to be Evil.
    - Else, we can only teach, to change the choice of those who make wrong choices, 
    - while doing the wrong choices, lead us to learn fast.

## Military and God in History

I don't like the military, when the objective is destructive.<br>
They learn to accept orders, without questioning them.<br>
They cannot deny them, or else, they will be punished.<br>
I don't know who love those systems, but I see that many do.<br>
Maybe God is there, trying to be happy with those who don't deny his will.<br>

- God is Good but kill us all, the Devil is Bad but make us Laugth.
    - I am sure that the "Devil" is the Guardian of Paradise.
    - The one who knows, who is Good or Bad, because God can be Mad.

## Books and God in History

All Religious books are like books-for-children.<br>

- They try to teach some basic values.
- They try to inform you about humans events.
    - Sadly many readers, don't think about what they read.
    - Sadly, most known religious books, become like "technical books"
    - People believe that what those books describe is God will, 
    - but for everything that Human create, is Human will, not God. 
    - God cannot write books, humans can.

## Humans and God in History

- There is a Room with one single Paint in the wall.
- We ask 5 persons to describe this Paint using text.
- At the end, we have 5 different descriptions of the same paint.
- **Question**: How many paints are in this room?
    - So many books that describe God.
    - So many groups compiting about which Book is True.
    - So many groups denying others interpretations of the same "object".
        - Maybe they don't wish to learn, while they love to compite.
    - "My book speak about the Truth, not yours, Both say".
    - I think people have some children inside, while that is not bad to the mind.

## Humans and Love in History  

What contradicts with Pleasure?<br>	
**Love**: "If you love, you are living happy. Don't be mistaken, Love is not Happiness."

- To those who have children and Love them, how many sacrifices you need to do?
- I am sure that those sacrifices, did not give you Pleasure.
    - Love ask dedication, persistence, 
    - we need to deny what we wish for us, 
    - to make the ones we love, happy. 
    - And if you make them happy, you will feel happy.
    - Only in that moment, you feel pleasure. 
        - Because the ones you love are good, not because you had an orgasm.

## The Divine Characteristic of Humanity

**God gave us the Free Will of Choice. So each one make choices.**<br>

- God don't care if humanity, 
    - kill each others for eternity or 
    - make sex compulsivly, 
    - while doing sex, is more productive, 
    - even if the objective is not to make children.
