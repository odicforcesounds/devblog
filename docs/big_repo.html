<h1 id="big-big-big-repository">Big Big Big Repository</h1>
<p>I normally like to clone some repositories to explore them at home,
offline, but sometimes, some repos are bigger than I could ever
Imagine.</p>
<p>https://github.com/mthcht/awesome-lists have about 25GB :o</p>
<p>Hopefully this repo is full of details that I will find them
useful.</p>
