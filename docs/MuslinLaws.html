      <p><a href="./GodDesire.html">God</a> in our Eternal process of becoming better in Time, never Ask Humans to punish others that deny each one beliefs, kill woman for being Free or naked, killing friends that make fun of us, and many other details that create the Muslin society as the most enprison society of the world. (They cannot be different from each others, and what <a href="./whatGodLikes.html">God</a> Love, is the Mix of what is not equal, dancing together with total respect from the <a href="./lawNaziCreativity.html">difference</a> that each individual may have in Memory. (As You may know, You are able to Breath, because that funcion is already in you when you Born. If you don't had that Memory in the Brain, your body would Die.</p>

     <p>God would never accept wars from any country in the world. All of them to all eternity who make use of them, they will be to "Hell". God would never accept to punish others from doing something wrong, or to kill others for denying His will, that only each can find, not others impositive Rules that demonstrate Domination and Control, which is against the Natural Flow.</p>

     <p>Popularity from Christiany, when a men desire is to punish someone, "The Devil is Testing", but we could say that in fact was God testing, since if you read the Bible and others, the temptation is what you should refuse to accept. I understand that sometimes we get mad, but is good to understand as well that we are Not Gods, and therefor, we cannot impose our choice to others. </p>
     <p class="center">In this Aspects (+1 to Christianity) that after all this time, <br>

     without the desire to punish ...
