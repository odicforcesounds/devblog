      <p>If you search a bit about "how criminals can be", you find that some of them are good, since they can give you the opportunity to earn money easly (which not all the systems in the world do that for you) and some of them, help the ones that are in fragile conditions to make their life a bit better. It is one of the most interesting behavior and choices that some criminal guys do. Naturally that some of them are bad to many, mainly if the targets are rich, while they demonstrate goodness by helping the ones that need.</p>
      <p>For the Governments and for all other commercial business, you are just a "thing" that can be used to grow the business, since this reality is based on ecomomy and economy is as well, part of the solution that create a mechanism of exchange, where everyone can feel and be free: (Free of Choice). You know when you see people on the streets begging for food or some drinks? Well, some drug dealers help them, by giving them food or drinks and sometimes help them on other things, when they see that these persons are good. (yes, criminals can see if someone have a good heart too, because they are humans too) and most of them, born inside that system that point as the unique solution, make business to get more money and with that, have a better life. For example, if you have a normal job, you can only buy a house (completly) almost in the end of your life (if you have the luck to get old) and Governments don't even care about, since who control that are the banks and the banks can make a big delay of payment when the Relationship if Governmental. Not all, but most. Most banks if they are in a fragile condition, Governments will give them some (extra money ( some billions)) so they can continue to manage money as they like, investing in whatever they like and continue loosing as much as they like, without any punishment against that irresponsability that should care the money they have, which is money that are not them.

      <p>Banks don't care about you, but about your money. If you don't pay, like criminal groups do but in a soft way, they will crush your life and remove all the things you have. NAturally Banks and some of the Legal systems of this world, are less criminal that the criminal groups, in that approach of how each one should pay what they should, but they continue to be more or less the same, since the condition to create the possiblity of someone that needs to pay, is not by giving them the opportunity to work to pay, but by applying some sentence against them.</p>
      <p>This remembers me some other common cases, that are about mothers or fathers that have low economic conditions to give a good quality to their sons, and what the legal system do, is taking their sons from them, which is stupid, because the solution should be to give them the opportunity the get the money they need to give to their sons a better life experience, with their sons company.
