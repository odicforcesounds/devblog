      <p>This is only a result of a process, while it is demonstrating more or less boring, if Linux, was only the programs that can be accessible from the terminal. What would change from Linux distros? I bet that many things could change too, in the directions of TUIs, while people love GUIs and Rats (mouse) :p </p>
      <p>So they use it.</p>
      <p>Anyway, this is just another <a href="./think_linux.html">Linux</a> review. I check out <a href="https://distrowatch.com/">distrowatch</a> some times, and we can say that, the majority are copies, but personalized. What is the background that you like most? Is amazing that, just few did reality touch the source, and even fewer did re-designed the main structure. Some maintained by single users, some others with groups.</p>
      <p>Like machine CPUs, the more people is colaborating in one single project, more stability and more personalized will be the result of that dedication, thinking and testing/coding/planing/designing/organizing all the details, by discussing them, adding in Notes, all possibilities that any worker, can "see" in their Imagination! :) Love to Imagination! The Source of Creation! </p>
      <p>I don't know exactly how many distros exist, but there are a lot! I could try to write about each, from american, chineses, japanese, brasilian, spanish, argentine, and many many others, including religious groups, while all others that don't declare them self's as being religious, they can be too. :) </p>
      <p>The creativity of Religions and Spiritual interpretations, the creativity of Cars designs, the creativity of Linux distributions, the creative mix of food to create a <a href="./awesome_story.html">awesome</a> meal, a creative list of many other things, movies, books, statues, buldings, roads, houses, etc, each adding/creating some change, to be personalized. </p>
      <p>And this is how the world "flows" into the <a href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Dao/index.html">way</a> of creation, which means, into the world of Imagination. </p>
      <p>This is what we all are. Copies with small changes, personalized in different bodies.</p>
