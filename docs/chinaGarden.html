      <p>How much everyone (USA) like to speak bad about China? Is rate to find someone that speak good things about China. But for this case, Peru is the "Target" of Chinese Investments to Rainforest Amazone Forests. You see, the best way to conquer someone or some country, is to invest on it. While USA investments are always on Bombs Guns and Wars, China Investments outside China, are not about Guns, Bombs and Wars, but for Nature improvewments and Futuristic Projects.</p>
      <p>I don't care how much you see China as something bad, which all have something bad, but I always like to see many things that China do and When I see those things that I like, I wish to write a "Appreciation Note" about China Investments. Most all things that USA use to attack China, is something that USA do regulary. Human Right? See for yourself how much USA violate all principles of Human Rights declarations. China do the same? Yes, they (both(USA & China)) are not the only ones, but you know, USA and China are like those lovers who love each others, but they are always fighting to demonstrate how better they are. Mainly USA that have that "Female" attitude to feel "beauty" and "desireble" to others.</p>
      <p>You see, there are many ways to conquer others. The best technique is using Music (only), the worst is by creating a conflict that will result in a war. Because, if you invest your money to improve some country, you will "own" part of that country economy without forcing them to accept something that they don't wish to support. Imagine that some country support more than 50% of the economy of some country. Whoever are the political parties of that country, they all depend on the ones that have injected money on their country. So, by that condition they will change their minds in the moment of making a decision, because they need to ask if the one that supports economy, agree with any political and economic decision. </p>
      <p>And at least for me, I in some aspects (not all), I prefer Chinese Iniciatives than USA iniciatives. Mainly when "Subjects" of "Power Control", are in cause. Because USA control can be good at some point, even if their support is purelly military content, while Chinese control, normally I see them better because they are not only (military support), but other kind of subjects that can improve some country. I really love many subjects and content created in <a href="./amazingUSA.html">USA</a>, but the "bad" I see on the "good", is higher than the Good. So.. what could be perfect is not, while I dislike all kind of celebrations and demonstrations of military power of any Asian country, like China, Japan and Korea's, I don't see a "compulsive" need, to support other countries ONLY on "Military supports". [Attention: I don't know everything, and USA can have investments that are productive that are not based on Military investment, but I don't know any example and therefor, I only write about what I know.] </p>
