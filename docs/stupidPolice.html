      <p>Did you know that more than 50% of police members, come from zones where drugs were having a fast development and that, take from them some friends? Maybe the ones that are Stupid are not the police but the Governments. Based on <a href="./clearAsWater.html">this</a> article, we can conclude that Governments are Stupid, while the police is stupid, in other aspect of the same subject. Here is what I see: Goverments are stupid when they don't legalize drugs. The problems that all these police members had, were the result of Goverments deny to control and legalize drugs. If Goverments control and legalize, no one could ever abuse and Die using drugs. But what makes police stupid, is not the fact of being police, but on beliving that, that "people die from consuming drugs, because drugs exist". No. People die as an effect of consuming drugs because there is no control on that. Goverments Crime. Does the police will arrest them? No. Is in that moment that Police are stupid.  </p>
