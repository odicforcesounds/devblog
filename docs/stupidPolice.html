      <p>Did you know that more than 50% of police members, come from zones where drugs were having a fast development and that, take from them some friends? Maybe the ones that are Stupid are not the police but the Governments. Based on <a href="./clearAsWater.html">this</a> article, we can conclude that Governments are Stupid, while the police is stupid, in other aspect of the same subject. Here is what I see: Goverments are stupid when they don't legalize drugs. The problems that all these police members had, were the result of Goverments deny to control and legalize drugs. If Goverments control and legalize, no one could ever abuse and Die using drugs. But what makes police stupid, is not the fact of being police, but on beliving that, that "people die from consuming drugs, because drugs exist". No. People die as an effect of consuming drugs because there is no control on that. Goverments Crime. Does the police will arrest them? No. Is in that moment that Police are stupid.</p>
      <p>But let us think a bit about this. Alcohol is not controlled, and it is at the same time. I mean, You can go into some coffee and ask several cups of wine. While you are free to consume until you get stupid in the mind, the ones who are selling you that product, can deny to sell it, based on some principle. Some coffees owners and employees have these principles and therefor, when someone is abusing, they stop selling it. When commercial houses control that, they are better than any goverment. For all other products should be the same, while if people die from smoking tabaco, is because there is no control on that, but just business. Goverments are the Highest <a href="./criminalMasters.html">criminals</a> in society. They just care about the money, nothing more. If people die in a compulsive way, they don't really care, if their deads have some economic return.</p>
      <p>I think police could become better, but they are treated like "toys", as they cannot have a personal opinion, they need to be shut up. They are "good dogs" as they do what other tell them to do, but that is a bit stupid, since they are not dogs at all. But you know, is the results of Military Education. Do what I tell you to do, or you will be punished. Criminality from the Gov.. Again! And those who deny what goverments say, are??? "Criminals".

      <p>The world is a funny place, and if you don't think about it, you will be just another piece of that game.</p>
