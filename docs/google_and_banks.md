# Google vs Banks

I take some much time to create an app (which is not complete, yet), and **Google Payment** is against payments that are not banks. 

My bank is against most payments that are from online companies, which include Google :) 

So, solving another problem with this kind of incompatibilities between giants: 

Application will not be in **Google Store** or **Apple Store**. ( Free for me and for everyone else) 

Binary (*.apk*) will be stored in Github releases. 

Solved.
