      <p><a href="https://historyofchristianitypodcast.com/2025/04/29/early-christian-attitudes-toward-military-service-first-500-years/">Here</a> is the "news" that are a bit old, but actual at the same time. If after 500 years (I guess it is 1500 years), the Church refuse to be part of the Military system, I see somehow a "Revolution" and "Evolution" from the Church, who have a <a href="./theGoodOnChristianity.html">Historical</a> Relationship with the Military.</p>
      <p>There are some details that are good. For example in a open-space full of dead bodies, there is (almost of the times) one single "Figure" that can pass without being killed: Nurses. They normally risk her lifes to save babies. You see, there is a dualistic Relationship when the Church have connections with the Military, because if in one side that Relationship should exist, by the principles of how to archive their own golds, what each "group" believe, there is some "Demonstration of Mercy" from the Military, when people that represent being part of the Church.</p>
      <p>So, if there are bad examples of "how much the Church cannot do anything against the military decisions", the Church is there to offer the illusion that life after death will be waiting for them. So, is like they are trying to be good in a condition where someone will be punished badly, and while that act of "goodness" looks good, it is evil at the same time, because there was no "resistence" against the <b>Service</b> that Victimize Jesus Christ, which was the Military.</p>
