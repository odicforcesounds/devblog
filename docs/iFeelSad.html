      <p>For all my life, I always "love" Asian Cultures. I love their celebrations, some of their food (since where I live, we cannot have everything they can, to eat), some of the classic books like the Dao De Ching, The Art of War and many other details that I always see as something fascinating. There was a connection from me to Japan and China, when I was very young, and today, after almost 40 years I start doing all this sites, just because something comes <a href="./about_me.html">from the sky</a>, which I describe as "God Will", that put me in this position, where I develop all this content, that is about human mind, justice, rationality and all the subjects I like to explore, since I am a Monkey and by default I have a Elastic Mind that permit me to simplify what many complicate. <br> <br> 

      Anyway, since I always try to have fun, when I see all this compulsive attacks against my sites, that are growing every day, I feel that "my love" reject me and with that, I feel I need to reject all the things that I imagine to be possible, to create this love relationship that history speak in history books, as something that was a bit positive, while many of them probably see it negative, as I can see from their feedback against all the content I create by myself, without the help of anyone else. <br> <br> 
     
      No business behind, no guards, no police, no military no companies, nothing. I invest in this work the last 10 years and then I start sharing it from the very first days, resulting after 10 years, in this feedback that demonstrate <a href="./understandingHaters.html">hate</a>. So all that I imagine to be possible is <a href="./false_hood.html">false</a> and what is true is that they don't like to see what I create, totaly dedicated to them, and following the lines that describe everything they create in time, as the example of everything they create in time. 600 Years of Good relationship and after so many centuries you do this to me. Then, you shall know that in the next Eternity, we will not be <a href="./theGardener.html">good</a> friends anymore.<br> <br> 

      It looks that, they refuse their own creations as well. Is like seeing Chinese that dislike the Sun Wukong, which was just a writter, nothing more than a writter. <br> <br> 

      No Hero, No fighter, No God, No soldier. Just a simple writter. <br> In any case, even if I continue doing what any writter could do, <a href="./offensiveMessage.html">they</a> reject me.</p>
