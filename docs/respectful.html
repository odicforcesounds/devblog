      <p>To question is the best choice, while saying what can be wrong, is not a bad choice, since someone can correct what we say or write, and with that feedback, we learn about what we wish to learn, while learning ask mistakes. One of this days, I was saying that "People who buy houses and in Time, cannot continue, because they lost their job, they should be helped in some way. This is because I find some people that describe me their situation based on the fact, that they stop paying to the bank and after less then 2 months, the bank expell them from the house they were about to buy. I am not sure if their stories are fully true, but I feel that I need to think about their situations and I demonstrate myself open to understand their situation. </p>
      <p>Being educated is more than being respectful, is more than being gentle. Sometimes I feel sad, because I cannot solve some problems, while sometimes I give suggestions and some try to follow in that direction, trying to fix their own problems in reality. I am glad that most of them, are able to solve their problems, while few others, don't even try.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I try to follow that romantic thinking where helping others is always fair, while some other moments, we see how much few, don't really care, and with them, my romantic perspective is broken and destroyed. When this "romantic perspective" is destroyed, I stop believing that, helping others can solve the problem. Maybe I am wrong, which is good in the perspective of those who wish to learn. Even the Wise need to learn, so if I wish to learn, I cannot escape from the condition of being wrong. Respect those who wish to learn and let them do and say, wrong things while doing mistakes!</p>
