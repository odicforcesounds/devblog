Managing a server, will be a awesome experience for me, since I always pay attention to **Security**, while have no intentions to use most Offensive tools, I really love to use the Defensive Tools. Therefor, is good to block, not all, but some, which [Fail2Ban](./crazyLife.md) can help. The Internet is awesome, and we always find someone else with the same problem or with some solution. Geolocation Lookup service in our servers, is a good approach to understand about the attackers, but I don't wish to understand them and therefor, a permenent Ban is the best choice.
