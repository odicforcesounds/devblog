      <p>From Rock to Heavy Metal, Blues, Country, Soul Music, Jazz, Movies of all kind, Software and Technology. This is how Amazing USA is to me. So, if they refuse to LOVE guns, bombs and all that nasty and creepy tools, that (Jesus Christ would Refuse to Use (God cannot Bless America)) which are useless and Evil, USA could become a place of Freedom. But they fall in Love with the possibility to penetrate other bodies without their will to be penetrated, and in that aspect of how humanity can have fun with sexual tools and for sexual moments, God is not satisfied with <a href="./thePlateOfNato.html">NATO</a> Choices.</p>
      <p>I think that, the Military should learn from America <a href="./leadersOfHistory.html">Leaders</a> that transform the world without using a single Gun. They are the Masters of the Art of Fighting without Fighting. They are like Gods, since they show Mercy and by that, Conquer Billions of Hearts without forcing them to accept being conquered by them.</p>
      <p>Since America have "Good Relationships with Israel", maybe we could ask USA to stop doing what God will Never Ever Accept in Human history, which is wars against civilians, since by logic, soldiers should be fighting each others, for the same reasons, far away from the ones they swere to save, which are the civilians. </p>
