      <p><b>Politics</b> is just a "Path" that represent a "Choice", that the majority agree with. Nothing more. With that, by logic, the majority follow the "Path" that was declared as a "Choice", to be the main objective and gold, of the majority that follow along. Nothing more!</p>
      <p>We see many times in several projects presentations, the question: is this subject about politics?</p>
      <h2 class="title3 center">EVERYTHING IS POLITCS</h2>
      <p>Each one choice, can be everyone choice, since Society and Polits is all about choices. If we are free to refuse to participate on someone else choice, we are Free. If we are obligate to participate, we are slaves. In society, time dedication, is the best "self sacrifice" that anyone can do in Time. What did change in Time? The subjects that we are paying attention, which are "choices" that could be everyone choice.</p>
      <p>You sit to pie? That is politics. You wake up and drink a cup of milk? That is politics. You find a solution to save energy? That is politcs. You refuse to accept evolution? That is politcs. You don't question you superior orders? That is politics. You question your superior orders and sometimes deny them? That is politics. You feed you son/daughter? That is politcs. You make sex with your lover? That is politics. You believe in ETs? That is politics. You believe in <a href="./style_of_god.html">God</a> ? That is politics. You don't like humanity? That is politics. You like Dogs Cats and all other livings beings like me? That is politics.</p>
