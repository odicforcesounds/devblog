      <p><b>Politics</b> is just a "Path" that represent a "Choice", that the majority agree with. Nothing more. With that, by logic, the majority follow the "Path" that was declared as a "Choice", to be the main objective and gold, of the majority that follow along. Nothing more!</p>
      <p>We see many times in several projects presentations, is this subject about politics?</p>
      <h2 class="title3 center">EVERYTHING IS POLITCS</h2>
      <p>Each one choice, can be everyone choice, since Society and Polits is all about choices. If we are free to refuse to participate on someone else choice, we are Free. We need are obligate to participate, we are slaves. Society as time dedication, as the best "self sacrifice" that anyone can do in Time. What did change in Time? The subjects that we are paying attention, which are "choices" that could be everyone choices.</p>
