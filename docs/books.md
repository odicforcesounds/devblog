# Books: I am selling Books 

I wish to sell some books. There are a lot of sites for this, but I think I will create my own. From Philosophy to Religions, Metaphysics, Politics, History and Psychology, Art, Poetry, Literature, etc... Most in Portuguese, some in Franch, English, Germany, Greek, Latin, Arabic, and I guess is all the languages of all books I have. They are almost 10.000 books. ;) 

Older and New. Is what I like to read without excluding the Technical ones about technology. 

In Reference to the [Dao Poem](./style_of_god.md): 

```
Monkeys jump from tree to tree,
some books were read by me,
like many of you could do,
since one plus one is equal to foo.

Foo is nothing,
while can be everything,
like the Dao (道) is.
```

From 10€ each. Islam? Christianity? Buddhism? Hinduism? Judeism? 

I will not sell all the "Bibles of each", since I wish to keep at least one of them. 

Everything else, can be yours. 

Lets build this really awesome website. :D
