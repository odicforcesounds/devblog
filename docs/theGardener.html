      <p>A "Perfect Garden", where every <a href="./offensiveMessage.html">flower</a> is in the perfect condition, treat it with care. A lot of flowers with a lot of colors with different shapes, some of them very small some others really big, colorful and full of vitality. I remember to be amazed, fearing to touch any of them, just because they were so perfect that harmonize my soul and I felt that this flowers were better than Gold.</p>
      <p>The Gardener was the <a href="./theKing.html">Dragon</a> and I was just that Monkey who could play there, with total freedom to jump and run, forgetting how much <a href="./seresPacificosEOfensivos.html">work</a> this garden ask to the gardener who takes the control of it, with all the care is needed to create an Harmony with all that complexity.</p> 
      <p>There was a Big Cat always around, which was the Tiger, the Guardian of this garden that always like to play with me</p>
