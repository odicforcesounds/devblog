      <p>More <a href="./memoriesFromOldTimes.html">memories</a> that my <a href="./usingTheBrain.html">brain</a> created, without my will to create, and therefor sometimes I feel I am getting crazy, while feeling that these kind of memories are not so bad to me. I don't really believe that we are here to accomplish something from some "life experience that happen somewhere in Time in another life", but I cannot deny that I have this "visions" and memories that I cannot explain them. </p>
      <p>Buddhism believe on this perspective of reborn, while if each knows how to fix what they did wrong in other lifes, their karma will be clear to the next state of conscience for the next life. Is what theories describe, while I don't believe, which is good if that is true, because we all need to learn from the mistakes we do.</p>
      <p>I remember to enter a "Perfect Garden", where every <a href="./offensiveMessage.html">flower</a> is in the perfect condition, treat it with care. A lot of flowers with a lot of colors with different shapes, some of them very small some others really big, colorful and full of vitality. I remember to be amazed, fearing to touch any of them, just because they were so perfect that harmonize my soul and I felt that this flowers were better than Gold.</p>
      <p>The Gardener was the <a href="./theKing.html">Dragon</a> and I was just that Monkey who could play there, with total freedom to jump and run, forgetting how much <a href="./seresPacificosEOfensivos.html">work</a> this garden ask to the gardener who takes the control of it, with all the care is needed to create an Harmony with all that complexity.</p> 
      <p>There was a Big Cat always around, which was the Tiger, the Guardian of this garden that always like to play with me</p>
