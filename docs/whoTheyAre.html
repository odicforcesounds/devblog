      <p>I am really fascitated with this project, I try to speak about these people on the <a href="./openbsdDevelopers.html">last</a> article, but in fact, I probably say something wrong, since I am not a expert and sometimes I confuse things, but since I believe that "The Erroneus Path" is the only one that can teach me, then sometimes I go into that direction, because I don't know. ;) Is what coders do, while in the process they learn how to do correctly the communication that needs to happen. At least coders will not destroy computers because they "deny to do what they wish to be done", because coders and education understand what fails, normally is based on the technique that didn't use the recommended way, to create the communication correctly. More Logic.. </p>
      <p>Anyway, lets talk about these guys who code and their projects. ( what they have more to show ) </p>
      <p>@nicm is the name of the user that probably love C. The guy have 2 programs made in C and is part of Tmux project that is made in C. This person is also contributor of OpenBSD like many others. So lets see others. @afh is a user with different "loves", let us say, since this person is part of NixOS, Tmux and others, which means that this user like to contribute to many other projects. @djmdjm is another user with a different set of mind, since this person have different languages of code made by himself. We can see, that most of them, fon't follow anyone. They are not there for "social activities" they are there to work on the direction their mind point, which is nice. @mpieuchot is a C lover. He likes Python too. @afresh1 is another Perl Lover. The guy dream about walking in a Camel for sure. @bluerise which is another C lover and a few of Go. This is a Google worker. Some of this guys use Mastodon, which is nice. @krytarowshi is another user who love C, Go and LLVM. Yeah, this is the guy I was talking in the above link text. And now, the only, the unique (lol) @dajohi. This guy Loves Go and he is part of the project called <b>btcsuite</b>, which looks a interesting idea to me, mainly if I think, if this project can be implemented in mine, somewhere in Time. Anyway, another interesting project that is about the same subject (blockchains), Decred is even Better, if implemented in what will be online soon.. </p>
      <p>@qbit is a really different user, since he code in different languages, but Go and C are the most used, including Python too. @fcambus is another C / Go lover, but this guy is more Low Level skilled, which include Assembly code. C, C++, Rust and some bash too. Awesome Ninjas! @jspricke is another compulsive coder, that is not so compulsive like many others, but this guy is part of many projects that can be interesting to see and explore. This one is more Python lover, while C in there as the source of knowledge. @tobhe is another C lover, and Debian lover. Very interesting. @noxxi is just another obcessive compulsive Lover of Perl. :) And finally I will not speak about anyone because there are many more, after making reference of @bluhm. Another C and Perl OCL with Cisco in Mind. You know, this guys are what I like in humanity, which is being focused in creating something to others, while to create something we need to known a lot and be pacient in the process of learning that is full of mistakes and errors, and without destroying what "doesn' t work as expected". ;) </p>
      <p><a href="./religions.html">Morality</a> is part of what I can see as Wrong or Correct, so after more than 20 centuries seeing what is wrong, is good to speak about what is right! </p>
